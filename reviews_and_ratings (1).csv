"I recently hired a car from Fox in Phoenix Arizona from the airport I booked it through auto/slash for $486 when I pick the car up, I was charged $846. I’ve tried to dispute it with no joy. The staff at the car handover were miserable rude and I would never use this company again.",1,AW,"October 22, 2024"
"Booked rental for pickup up in Aruba, reservation was booked 3 days prior to our arrival for 9:30 am pickup. At 9:00 am get a text asking for our flight number which we replied back we arrived the night prior. We are advised at this time the car was rented out 5 days earlier and is not due back until 1:00 pm. When I called, I spoke to a manager that was totally incompetent. Her position was that the car rental system does not align the times but clearly they knew my time was 9:30 AM pick up and that the car that was rented five days prior was not due until 1 PM. This company is a total joke and when you call their customer service it’s people in the Philippines, which barely could understand English do not rent from Fox. They are the most unprofessional car rental company I’ve ever dealt with! So planning our day is not important to this company since they lack the business professionalism to notify the Customer ahead of time so much for planning our day!",1,US,"March 03, 2025"
"An employee for us traveled to Tampa. First mistake was using Expedia. In no obvious place did it tell you the renter has to have a credit card and not a debit card in his name before renting. He does carry a company debit card in his name. Nothing during the rental process stated this. We try to never travel with credit cards or any cards we do not need. Fox would not rent him the car paid for in advance. They had a sign that specifically read, ""if thius happens request your refund from the third party used to secure the rental. That would be Expedia. Once he was left 1000 miles from home with no transportation he went to Next car rental and within 10 minutes had a vehicle. Be aware of the scams Expedia and Fox car rental run. Look around the internet. They do this to unsuspecting travelers everyday all over the country, then keep their money. Nice racquet.",1,US,"February 25, 2025"
"I reserved a luxury car. They jerked me around for an hour saying it was delayed, then needed cleaned, when I bitched about the wait, they offered me an upgrade for $65 a day for 41 days. When I said No, they offered me a choice of 2 cars in a lower rate class that they said were ready to roll (no refund for the lower rated vehicle). 25 minutes after I agreed, they said the delay was due to it needing to be cleaned. Since I had to wait I told them Id take the original car I reserved, then they told me they didnt have one. Lied to me from the beginning attempting to get me to pay more for the rental. Their extra charges, not disclosed ar time of reservation are excessive.  I declined everything BUT the agent put them on the bill. I MADE him remove them and then I started being ignored. I asked for a supervisor and the agent gave me the name of a vehicle intake guy, not a supervisor. When I got to the real manager, she was awesome, she dealt with me being outraged and offered me a small discount. I ended up with a lesser vehicle with a sports seat that isn't any good for a guy w 4 lower back surgeries and lots of metal. I had to roll out of this piece of garbage and Im expected to keep it for the whole 6 week rental. This is not over.I will never ever trust this company again regardless of the rates.I spent nearly 2 hours at the office with poor results. I prepaid the reservation so they couldnt refund it so I could go to a reputable rental car company.  This company deserves and works hard to get their 1.1-1.6 rating",1,US,"February 26, 2025"
"We reserved a vehicle for April 29th, but had to cancel due to unforseen sale of our son and daughter in laws property where they were renting, had to cancel the vacation, and reservation, Fox refused to refund the deposit because of their ridiculous no refund policy, really? Canceled over 2 months ahead of time,  I don't care what policy you carry, unforseen incidents and canceling over 2 months ahead of time should be a customer courtesy not a customer ripoff, ",1,DK,"February 19, 2025"

"Avoid Fox Car in Morocco – Hidden Fees & Terrible Service!I had an awful experience renting a car from Fox Rent a Car in Marrakesh Airport, Morocco. They charged me €25 for an AdBlue tank that was completely empty after just one day of rental! This is a clear scam – they either gave me a car with an almost empty AdBlue tank or deliberately set it up so I’d be forced to refill it myself.When I reached out to them about the issue, their customer service was useless – completely dismissive and unwilling to help. Instead of admitting their mistake, they just brushed me off and refused to take responsibility. This is nothing but a cheap way to extract extra money from customers.If you’re thinking about renting from Fox Rent a Car in Marrakesh, Morocco – DON’T! Be ready for hidden fees and unethical business practices. There are plenty of other rental companies that won’t try to rip you off.Save yourself the frustration and go elsewhere!",1,US,"February 05, 2025"
"Kind of a mixed bag.  Made a reso through priceline for a vehicle at St. Maarten airport.  Shuttle experience was fine- Fox is actually Europcar there.  However, upon arriving at the office another client and I were told that there were no cars available, despite both of our confirmed reservations.  The manager said that he was only honoring pre-paid reservations.  The other gent ended up securing a car after he told them that a local friend had called to make the reso.  I think I looked so deflated and defeated that they decided they had a car for me after all.  The next shuttle arrives and I heard them tell 10 more people there were no cars available even though they also had reservations-  who knows how many people were in the same situation.My rental ended up being fine, but only through luck-  if pre-payment is required they should relay this to priceline, or just ensure the number of reservations matches the number of vehicles (seems pretty basic logic for a car rental company).  Needless stress upon arrival for vacation.",3,GB,"January 18, 2025"
"Worst service we have ever received, we paid for our biking prior to travelling. When we went to pick up our prebooked and paid for rental we were told they can see we’ve made a payment but can’t find the booking despite having a booking reference. We were asked to pay again and told we can request a refund for the original booking.We have number n back and fourth with Fox rental, carjet and you do Spain to no prevail. We are owed £239.36 which may seem like a trivial amount but to us it’s quite a bit of money.I have disappointed by the lack of reply from carjet. We have never hired a car through carjet, fox rental or you do Spain before and we now will never use them again and will tell all our friends and family and our contacts in the travel industry never to recommend them.It is appalling how they think it’s ok to not refund what is due, when we work so hard for every cent and can’t afford not to be refunded,It has been just shy of four month chasing our refund.",1,US,"November 15, 2024"
"Over an hour wait in line to pick up the car, quoted 71.00 for a day rental, total came to over 125.00 due to all the hidden charges.The staff were all unacceptably rude, and the drop off is NOT at the Miami airport, I had to pay for an uber from the rental to the airport. Never again. ",1,US,"February 02, 2025"
We rented a car from Fox car rental online about 3 months in advance. We get to Miami. The Fox line had about 40 people in it. We finally get to the front. The didn’t have cars. They wanted to charge us an extra $250 and bring in a car from another location. We took a taxi back to the airport and rented a car from Avis. We saved a lot of money. Fox is a hassle. There low prices are too good to be true! Stay away! Use a reputable car rental company!,1,US,"April 02, 2024"
"I rented a car 2 days before my trip. I had never rented from Fox before. Everything went really well. The shuttle came as soon as we walked out of baggage claim. The woman driving the shuttle was kind, upbeat and so helpful-great personality! No wait to speak of at Fox. David, the manager was terrific and within minutes we were on our way. Will absolutely use them again. Best of all the were incredibly reasonable!",5,EC,"January 18, 2025"
These people are thieves and booking.com is with them and will not guarantee any customer defense. I paid $309 in booking.com for the car rented and insurance of $50 . It was a huge disappointment as well because they lead me to the FOX- EUROPCar stealers that charge me $96.13 for tolls and bridges services that I didn’t use because I was hosted in Pompano beach and it was just one day that I travel to Sawgrass Mills and to El Doral . These is a horrible business and their customer service are low people that would be over flattering to trap you . ,1,US,"November 30, 2024"
"Horrible experienceRented a car in San Diego, should of read the reviews would have changed my mind. The hidden fees are there, they will get a 50$ fee wether they call it a late or extension fee.

"Horrible experience in LAX  Ca.!Horrible experience in LAX ,LA Ca.!! Fake pleasant LADY said they did Not have car i contracted to rent through Expedia. “Only had” LUX  CAR, for  $180 dollars more.  Legally, they need to provide similar car, for same price.I didn’t see final bill, until weeks later. They charged me $500 extra plus additional fees!!! My Expedia receipt said my payment included all taxes and fees.",1,US,"December 22, 2024"
"The employee working at the Salt Lake City Fox Rent a Car counter directly lied to me. The whole Fox rental procedure is systemically designed to defraud renters. Here was my experience, which I observed replicated for the customers before and after me. First, they imply that renters must get a Loss Damage Waiver. This is not necessary, but Fox calls one level the ""minimum"" level, when in fact a LDW is not required. When asked about it, the employee suggested that I had to have proof that my insurance would cover rental car damage. When I pushed on this, she admitted the proof she had just asked for was not required. Next, she tried to email the contract to ensure that the I did not see that the LDW and roadside assistance had been added.I asked for a printed copy and saw that these fees were there. I asked her to remove the LDW and she told me it had been removed. I then did the vehicle inspection and returned the form to her. In fact, she had not removed the LDW. Had I then asked for a new printout of the contract, I would have seen this, but I stupidly trusted that it had been removed. After checking in the car, on my way to the airport, I found out that I had been charged an additional $380 in fees I had specifically, explicitly declined and had been told had been removed.Moral of the story -- don't drive away until you have a printed contract in your hand showing that no additional fees are being charged.",1,US,"December 26, 2024"

"Mask mandates? Seriously, Not happening. You will receive an email that masks are required for pickup an drop off. People will not learn until we all stick together and say no more nonsense. Canceled my reservation, back to Avis I go. ",1,US,"December 21, 2024"
"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! This was the WORST rental experience I have ever had or imagined. We reserved and paid for a full size SUV (7-9 seat) to Caravan to Florida from Georgia (we live locally) specifically to fit 7 people to a wedding.  Not only did they say they didn't have any more full sizes, they refuse to compensate for our reservation in any way. I was at one point hung up by their billing department saying they will have a supervisor call me (never did). We had to take 2 cars to get all of us there (which of course defeated the whole purpose). I am most frustrated that we kept being put off to reach out after returning for compensation only to be told there was no solution. I assume this was so we didn't return the vehicle right away. The lack of accountability and professionalism (even without a refund) is unbelievable. I will be reporting them to the BBB since we have lost out on near $400 (not including the second car we had to take). I blame myself for not checking their ratings before booking.

"We rented a vehicle at Fox in Las Vegas. The price quoted was $224. We fillled it full with gas prior to bring ing back. Dropped it off with Fox employee. He provided paper to us. The next day I reviewed all my credit charges online with my Visa company and saw where Fox charged $330! I called and a person named Michael stated the charge was for not bringing the car back full and they had to put 11 gallons back into it.  What? It was full.  He said that if I wanted to question it, that I would need to send screenshots of my credit card bill. So I did this; still no response after two weeks. So I called again and spoke to another employee and they gave me another email to use. I sent same info to him and still no response. Now it has been 22 days and no email response. I am very disappointed in how they can add fake charges. The tank was full! Make sure if you rent from Fox that you take pictures of your full tank, make sure the employee starts the car and sees that it is a full tank; get that employee's name, and hope they don't gouge you.

I reserved a car from fox using rentcar.com but they charge to my credit card additional payments besides that the reservations says that I didn't need to pay anything more. Currently i am disputing the additional charges but I think I will not recover the money back. ,2,US,"December 03, 2024"
"On 10/30/24, during the car rental process at Fox Rent A car. I was pressured into signing a car rental agreement in a small tablet with just the signature/initial box without letting me see what I am signing.  All I saw was the blank signature/initial box that Christina at Fox Rent A Car Las Vegas asked me to sign and initial.  I don't even know I am signed up for all the rental car add-on of $379.42.  After I signed the agreement form, Christina gave me the agreement form of $521.75.  I asked “What is this $521.75 is for?  Since I already paid for the total car rental cost of $142.33 to Fox Rent A Car on my credit card on 10/28/24” Christina told me “It is a temporary credit card hold, and I won't be seeing this $521.75 hold after I returned the rental car”.  After I returned my rental car, I received a receipt of 521.75, in which $379.42 is the rental car add-on that I have no knowledge about that was charged to my credit card.  After checking my credit card account, those charges are real charge and are not temporary credit card hold like Christina said.  This transaction process is a scam and a very bad business practice, which is totally unacceptable.  In addition, I am being charged 6 times on airport shuttle fees when I only used the shuttle two times, to and from the airport. The pressure tactics, the lies, and doesn't let customers see what they are signing into lure customers on purchases of all the rental car add-on are unacceptable. I won't be going back to Fox Rent A Car ever again. Based on thousands of reviews on the internet complaining the same things on bad business practices and tactics that Fox Rent A Car used, it is recommended not go to with this rental car company.",1,US,"October 30, 2024"
Not enough agents at Fort Lauderdale. Waited over an hour in line to pick up my car. Only 3 agents and at lest 20 customers. No other agencies had anything near as long of a wait. ,1,GB,"November 25, 2024"
"If only I could give 0 starsI won't explain the whole situation, but essentially we needed our car changing during a trip as the tires kept loosing pressure. We reported the problem, they suggestion was to take it to a garage the next day, problem, it was the 4th July the following day and we had reservations at Mt Rainer. We were currently in forks, no way would anything be open. But, they assured us it would. Surprise, surprise the next day, nothing was open. So we had to wait over 8 hours for them to bring us a new car from Seattle to Forks.I have been having an exchange of emails with them recently, finally agreeing to a refund of half the amount. Which originally started as them saying they would only go as far as a mere 25% - This is still going on, even though they have a agreed, I have had 0 response since this. Appalling customer service, this matter could have been dealt with if they actually listen to customers, rather than following a script. We're not even American, even we knew the 4th July was a pretty big deal.....",1,US,"July 03, 2024"
"Fox Rent-A-Car is an absolute disaster, and I would give ZERO STARS if I could. Not only did they fail to provide the service I paid for, but they also lied to my credit card company to avoid refunding $571.12. This company is a SCAM, and their shady practices are nothing short of theft.I booked an 11-day car rental on May 4, 2024, for $571.12, to visit my blind, widowed, 75-year-old auntie with stage 4 cancer. When her health emergency forced me to change my travel dates, Fox Rent-A-Car refused to apply my credit—on THREE separate occasions: June 3rd, June 9th, and July 17th.As a Lahaina wildfire survivor, I was adjusting to traffic disruptions from debris removal and road repairs. I pride myself on punctuality, yet on July 16th, I missed my flight for the first time in 50+ years due to road closures caused by wildfire debris removal, boulders, and guardrail repairs. I called Fox immediately to inform them I’d be 24 hours late and asked them to hold my reservation. Instead of helping, they forced me to cancel and charged $26 to rebook. After 36 minutes of waiting and multiple holds, they claimed ""computer problems"" prevented them from rebooking and told me to try online. I spent hours trying, but it didn’t work.When I arrived at their rental location, they claimed I had no reservation, they were out of cars, and they refused to honor my credit with their sister company. They attempted to charge me over $750 for fewer days than I originally booked—$250 MORE than I already paid—and told me I’d need to return the next day to pick up a car. My destination was 40 minutes away without traffic, leaving me stranded.When I asked for a supervisor, I was pressured to accept the inflated price. After I refused, they hung up on me again. Later that night, I saw the price had increased to $978.80, nearly double my original reservation cost.The worst part? Fox Rent-A-Car lied to my credit card company (Hawaiian Airlines Bank of Hawaii World Elite Mastercard). They falsely claimed they refunded $500 of my $571.12 on May 4th, 2024. This was a LIE—the $500 was a deposit charge unrelated to the $571.12 rental fee. Despite showing my Barclay statement proving this, my credit card company sided with Fox Rent-A-Car, claiming my dispute was only for $71.12 because ""services were rendered.""Fox Rent-A-Car repeatedly promised I could use my credit, but they failed every single time. The final blow? Being abandoned at the airport during a family emergency without a car and with no help from their so-called customer service, which was rude, incompetent, and repeatedly hung up on me.This company’s behavior is beyond unacceptable. They’ve kept over $500 of my money for MONTHS without providing any service. This is corporate greed at its worst—Fox Rent-A-Car feels entitled to keep my money while lying about refunds and failing to deliver the promised service.Let’s not forget that Fox Rent-A-Car is now owned by Europcar Mobility Group, one of Europe’s largest car rental companies. If this is how Europcar operates in the U.S., customers should beware on both continents! It seems Europcar has brought its corporate greed and deceptive practices to the U.S., leaving customers stranded and out hundreds of dollars.If you value your time, money, and sanity, STAY FAR AWAY from Fox Rent-A-Car and Europcar Mobility Group. They are a SCAM, and their predatory behavior should not be tolerated.",1,GB,"July 16, 2024"
"Easily the worst car rental experience O have ever had. 1 hour line at San Diego Airport - surly/unhelpful staff, did not have car that I booked, tried to add all sorts of additional fees. NEVER EVER EVER use this company —- go with someone reputable!!!!",1,US,"November 15, 2024"
"I recently rented a car from Fox at LAX, and I must say, it was an outstanding experience from start to finish. The booking process was seamless and easy, with a user-friendly website that made selecting the perfect vehicle a breeze.When I arrived to pick up the car, the shuttle bus operators and staff were incredibly friendly and professional, offering helpful advice and making sure I had all the information I needed. The car itself was in pristine condition—clean, well-maintained, and ready to go. It was a pleasure to drive, and I appreciated the convenience of picking up and returning the vehicle with minimal hassle.The entire rental experience was efficient, and the pricing was transparent with no hidden fees, which I really appreciated. I also liked that they offered flexible rental terms, which suited my travel plans perfectly.Overall, I highly recommend Fox for anyone in need of a reliable and affordable car rental. Excellent service, great selection of vehicles, and a stress-free process. I will definitely be using them again next time I'm in town!",5,US,"November 07, 2024"
"Lied to and cheated.  Booked my rental car and paid for insurance through Expedia.  Upon arrival at Fox I was told Expedia insurance was not accepted, so I purchased Fox insurance.   Followed up with Expedia, and I was lied to... Fox does accept Expedia's insurance.  Attempts to be reimbursed for the insurance were a hassle, but eventually denied by Fox.  Also, they charge a 450% administrative fee on road tolls.  ",1,GB,"October 11, 2024"
"Rented via AutoEurope.  The rental agreement was with Europcar but they outsourced to Fox Rent a Car.  We were collected by the Fox bus and taken to the off-site rental location.  The agent tried to scam / defraud me into taking their Toll package even though I explained I had my own Toll Transponder and account with SunPass.  He lied and said the plates were locked and that I would not be able to used the transponder on their vehicles.  I challenged him and he got irritated and said I would be charged around $15 dollars for every toll use.  I didn't believe him and declined their Toll package.  The car was a mess.  Scratches both on the outside and on the inside plastic.  The seats were stained and the parcel shelf was missing, making shopping a challenge as all of our purchases were on display to any thief.  The car wobbled due to badly balanced wheels and the Oil service was overdue.  Would not ever rent from them again and will be aware that Europcar do not have their own presence at Orlando MCO.  Worst car I have ever rented and I rent a lot of cars.",1,US,"October 19, 2024"
"I firmly believe I was intentionally DECEIVED by the agent at Denver Fox car rental. The agent told me that I would be passing through tolls and a pass was a requirement. Not that the tolls were actually optional express lanes. He talked about how expensive it would be if I chose to pay the tolls myself vs. getting a pass. Never haven driven in the state before, I was expecting toll booths like they have in the northeast where you really are required to pay to drive on the road. This was most definitely a deception. Additionally, I did NOT need the extra insurance and told the agent that. I told him that my insurance policy covered me when driving rentals and he responded ""okay.""At the end, when I asked why the numbers were so HIGH on the paperwork, he LITERALLY told me to IGNORE them because that was just the deposit, which would be returned to me after I returned the vehicle, and not to worry because I already pre-paid through Expedia. He definitely gave me the impression the ONLY additional charges would be for the pass (which I ultimately did not need) and gas if returned at half a tank (I returned it with a full tank). Yes, I should have read every single word of the paperwork and asked more questions. However, I have rented from multiple other car agencies -- Hertz, Enterprise, Budget, Dollar and Thrifty -- without ever occurring a single extra charge and didn't realize that I needed to guard myself against an unscrupulous rental agent. Stupidly, I believed his lies vs. reading the fine print. I believe that the Fox agent knew that I was tired after traveling for many hours, wasn't familiar with the roads or requirements in Colorado, and PREYED upon the fact that I was a single, older female traveling alone. The rental agent and his employer should be ashamed. ",1,CA,"October 30, 2024"
"The rental went fine enough, but the car was damaged in a parking lot by a third party.

"We reserved a car a Fox Rental Orlando. I called while we were waiting at the luggage carousel, to let them know we had arrived and that we would be cutting it close to our designated pick-up time. The girl reassured me there was no problem and the shuttle would be picking us up in a few minutes. After waiting at B11 for 30 minutes no shuttle had arrived, so I call again to be sure we're in the correct spot. She again reassures me it'll only be a few minutes. After nearly an hour of waiting for ""a few minutes"" I call again. We are tired from our long flight and waiting this long with 2 kids was a test in patience. As she is saying ""just a few more minutes the shuttle"" pulls up. Another guest was more upset than we were. The driver mumbled that he was here already. But he must have been invisible because the 4 in our party and the other man waiting never saw a shuttle. It was very frustrating. We won't rent from Fox again.",1,US,"October 15, 2024"

I was offered no assistance at fox, apologies or care for the welfare of my young child that thankfully was not in the car when the incident happened with the tire.

"I had a fantastic experience renting a car through Fox in LA Los Angeles (via Europcar). Everything went smoothly from start to finish. The car was great—brand new with only 900 miles on it and in perfect condition. Driving it was a pleasure.  We had the car for more than two weeks and did about 4,000 miles without any issues.The manager was incredibly helpful and took the time to explain everything clearly, ensuring I understood all the details of the rental. On top of that, they gave priority service to Europcar customers, which made the whole process even faster and more convenient.I highly recommend renting through Fox and Europcar. Great service, helpful staff, and an overall hassle-free experience!",5,N/A,"September 19, 2024"
"I rented a Toyota Corolla from Fox at Chicago O'Hare.  The handling characteristics of the car did not seem quite right and it was very uncomfortable at speeds over 60mph.  When I arrived at my destination in Madison, WI, I looked at the tire treads and they appeared to be in poor condition.  The next morning, the low tire pressure caution light was on.  I purchased a tire pressure gauge and was shocked that 3 of the tires exceeded the limit of the tire pressure gauge (55 psi).  the 4th tire pressure was 24 psi.  The limit on the tire pressures was 35 for the front and 33 for the rear.  I called the Fox roadside assistance line,  was on hold for quite awhile and left a call back number.  Fox did not contact me, despite their automated voice indicating that they would.  There was no way that I could drive this car on freeways back to Chicago, so I called Fox roadside assistance the following morning and was able to reach a helpful agent.  He directed me to Discount Tire in Madison, WI.  The technician at Discount Tire stated ""looks like they were trying to kill you.""  The tires were ""shot"" from massive overinflation.  Fox agreed to have all 4 tires replaced.  Unfortunately, I missed the majority of scheduled events on my trip, as I had had a dangerous car, and spent my time performing Fox Car Rental's job for them.  The response of Fox has been completely unsatisfactory.  This is a dirt bag organization that does not perform the most basic maintenance on their vehicles and has no regard for the safety of their customers.",1,US,"July 17, 2024"
"Fox Rental Car charges for shuttles from the airport to their location and it takes about 30 minutes for the ride.

Their customer service is in the Philippines and they are not helpful, do not send the promised documents.Upon returning the car, Fox Car Rental representative was not willing to come and check the vehicle despite standing in 12 feet from the car and did not provide me with the folio – explanation of charges. On the following day they charged my card $180 for cleaning fees and they said that I was smoking in the car, which is not true since we are nonsmokers. The Merchant also made a separate false charge of $54.86 on the same day saying that I did not return the car with a full tank of gas. Overall, with the fraudulent charges this company has the highest rental prices. ",1,CH,"June 24, 2024"
"The sales lady at Seattle, I think it was Catherine, was extremely pushy and aggressive. She actually bullied us into buying daily ""PLATEPASS INCLUSIVE"", telling us that there are tolls every few miles in Oregan and California and that they can be as expensive as $22 a time!!  This is just not true!  I think we went through 3 tolls during our 3,300 km road trip through Washington, Oregan and California and the charge was around $3 a time.  This is simply a scam for Fox sales people to earn extra commission and for Fox to pocket more money.Its a shame, because apart from this the experience could have been good.",2,US,"October 03, 2024"
"I rented from Fox Rent A Car in Austin.  When the agent asked which coverage, I said basic.  He applied the full charges and when I was signing the agreement the screen was so small I could not read the agreement.  I never received a paper or printed agreement either or I would have checked. I contacted customer service and they refused to refund. ",1,GB,"September 18, 2024"
"I'm a UK resident and tried to book a car with this outfit in Los Angeles. Yeah, great unbeatable prices but just one problem.....when you get directed to their""payment information"" their site won't accept a UK postcode which means they won't accept your card payment which means you don't get to rent with them!!  Thought it was an error so emailed them, been over 2 weeks and they still can't be bothered to reply. They obviously don't need my custom, avoid like really avoid. ",1,US,"October 03, 2024"

"Jennifer was simply amazing. She saw that I was not having a good morning and she took time to talk to me, gave me water and candy because I was forced to sleep in the airport over night and had not eaten. She spoke positivity and wisdom to me and she really turned my day around which helped me leave with a positive attitude and new perspective on life. Angels are here on earth and she is one of them.",5,US,"September 26, 2024"
"The positive - The 2 shuttles going to Fox were okay. The service rep behind the counter was good although we didn't need to hear he spends his day in the casino. We were upgraded because our rental was not available. The Negative - We had to wait 15-20 minutes when next in line because all the reps were outside showing renters to their vehicle? Obviously need more staff or a better process.I was told to just take the car under the streetlight to check for damage, it was not bright. The vehicle was dirty on the outside not washed,, Inside was clean except for the odor of cigarettes. Returning the vehicle the rep outside didnt even look at it and just said okay its good. I video taped for my protection the condition of the car.Both bathrooms were out of order! Why not get a port o let or plumber right away?The trip back to the airport drop , the driver did not assist with any baggage, did not greet anyone, and didn't inform to lay down luggage as it all rolled around while traveling, this cause passengers to get up to retrieve their bags while vehicle was moving.",2,GB,"September 28, 2024"
"For international travellers.  Please be careful, the staff at the Fox locations might be helpful, but if anything goes wrong with fees and charges, they’ll wipe their hands of the whole issue and send you to billing.Racking up so much additional cost calling from abroad as they don't respond to emails. Europcar aren’t great at the best of times but the American standard of accountability, access and customer protection, might not be what you're used to.",1,US,"August 27, 2024"
"My son and I were on the same web site across the country from each other, and didn't see the same things. I went ahead and reserved a small car and planed on getting upgraded when I got the SeaTac. I told them what happened and they did upgrade me, for a price of course.  I am 75 and 5'3.  They put me in a Toyota 4 Runner.  I could hardly get in.  I should have gone back to the counter and gotten a different car but I was too tired.  Otherwise I was satisfied, but it was a little pricey for me.",4,US,"September 17, 2024"
Do not ever go to this company I paid $466 I never got a car and I had to go to another company to rent a car they stole my money,1,US,"August 02, 2024"
When we arrived to pick up rental car the agent I spoke with was all about business.  He got me in and out in about 3-4 min. He did try to up sell the $12 a day toll payment. But did not persist. I was on my way to my rental car before the 2 groups who were being helped before me. Now the bad part.... we had to return our rental the next day because there was a strong order in the car. They replaced that rental with a new rental car and upgraded us. And that process was just as quick as when we 1st picked up rental. It sucked to drive back to rental car company but they made it painless. So I would recommend Fox. Now this is an FYI... Orlando/MCO rental office does close (not sure of closer time). They don't open till 5am. So if you have an early flight you may have issues getting to flight on time. So my final thoughts is the price for the rental was great and they made the process quick and easy. I was gonna take a star for rental return but they made up for it by getting us in and out with an upgrade. ,5,US,"September 05, 2024"
"I will NEVER rent from them again. (1) The checkin/car pick up experience was awful and took over an hour (they don’t offer pre-checkin so you can go straight to your car); (2) customers (not their staff) are responsible for marking on a drawing all possible damage they see on the car before they leave with the vehicle; (3) they use bait and switch pricing and say unlimited miles but when I checked in there was a restriction on distance and only driving in the pickup state and the state to the left and right, and if you breached that, there would be a crazy penalty fee charged (I believe $1,000) and they use gps to track where the car goes; (4) I had to extend my stay twice for a family issue and it was really hard to reach anyone in customer service to do that; and (5) when extending, they charge you the normal daily/weekly rental rate + a penalty for extension + a per day extension fee on top of the normal rate. I’ve shared the experience with a few friends and they each had similar experiences and none of us will ever use them again.",1,GB,"September 14, 2024"

TOTAL TRASH",1,US,"May 25, 2024"
I have never rented a car and the agent asked if I wanted just the liability insurance. The agent did not let me know I could decline that. When I got my bill I had a $132 fee for insurance. I disputed and they are not willing to remove or reduce the fee. Also the car had a leak and I had to fill it up with air everyday I had the car. They were not willing to reimburse any fees for the hassle,1,US,"August 21, 2024"

"Within 36 hours of picking up my rental car I had 3 different vehicles. 20 miles from my destination, the first vehicle lost all safety features and the brake booster. I received a second car and it was stalling out and had thick white smoke blowing out of both tail pipes. Had a third car towed to me which finally seemed to work fine. Was promised a credit for all of this and was only partially credited for a waiver I declined in the very beginning...and should never have been charged for at all. Horrible rental car experience especially when I was in an unfamiliar state, dealing with memorial stuff and transporting my 90 year old Grandmother. My confidence in the vehicles this place rented me was so low that I rented a hotel room and left for the airport the night before. Figured at least if I broke down again I would have enough time to get an Uber to make my flight home.",1,GB,"August 14, 2024"
"We arrived from the UK after a long flight with 3 children to find out that they hadn’t got the car size we had reserved, we ordered a large SUV but you only had a small SUV available, for 7 people this wasn’t suitable and no alternative was being offered despite us constantly telling the staff member how we can not all fit into this SUV.Eventually another staff member found us a large mini bus that we could use for an additional cost, luckily the manager that checked the bus back in cancelled that additional cost as it wasn’t our fault the car we hired wasn’t available. (This was only after we went to the desk to complain, as we hadn’t realised the difference in cars being offered until we saw how big the car was we originally tried to book was)Throughout the duration of the holiday we kept seeing large bugs in the car seats and van. It was easy to record as they were consistently seen running around the car in the late evening. The cockroaches were frequently spotted in the baby seat- this is disgusting and made us all feel sick. I then saw the roaches going in between the windows and plastic seal, I tried to recorded this but they were too quick. I tried to resolve at the airport but was advised by the manager that I needed to email but still haven’t got a response from them.Poor overall and wouldn’t use fox again ",1,US,"August 02, 2024"

They kept me waiting a long time and said there was a system error, I was tired and feel they tricked me into getting extra insurance and other charges I didn’t agree too. I was then sent a bill for tolls with an added $90 admin fee just for a letter…..when I tired to contact them they ignored my emails and just took the money out of my account without my permission. I would avoid at all costs. ",1,US,"July 01, 2024"

There were issues with my reservation at Thrifty, and the only other companies that were still open were  Avis and Fox. The line at Avis was huge, and chances of them having a car available without a reservation were not good. So, I went straight to Fox, and rented a Toyota 4 Runner for the price of a mid size car. In fact, I ended up paying less than I would have at Thrifty. The service was great. Thank you Fox",5,US,"August 09, 2024"
We rent a car through Expedia from Fox at Seattle Airport and it was my worst car rental experience. We wait in line for more than an hour  and had to leave to get car from another car rental place because we had an important event to attend. We had more than 10 people ahead of us when we left and that was after waiting for more than hour in line. The agents were taking more than 20 minutes to attend a single customer. This happened on 07/26/2024. They also refused to give us our return even though we didn't get the car and had wait in line for more than an hour.

"Fox Rent A Car is the least legitimate rental car company I have every encountered. When renting my car online, I specifically declined all insurance coverage in booking my rental. When on site, I did have to pay extra due to the need to rent a child safety seat. I made a comment to the rep that the charge on the documentation was higher than expected, and he said don't worry about it, it is just a deposit. Upon return of the car, I was charged far beyond just a child safety seat, even though I paid for the rental in advance. This is because of the excess insurance I did not authorize. To make matters worse, because they captured my digital signature, they were able to apply it to documents I never saw to make it look like I agreed to pay for the excess insurance, despite what I had been told about it being ""just a deposit."" I tried to contact customer service, but they were unwilling to assist. I further tried to get help via Visa, but because of the digital signature they captured, the documentation tells a story that is different from the truth.

"I ordered an SUV to drive into the mountains into Breckenridge CO. I had planned on a small SUV with plenty of power to get up there. I was instead given a Nissan Kicks... which while new... did not have 4WD or an engine capable of safely getting up the mountains.... This car struggled so much we had to stop 3 times on the way into Breck.... At the counter when i rented the car, they told me they had other cars that I could use but it essentially doubled my rental cost... After returning my rental, i was overcharged for fuel (filled up in Denver but still missing 3 gallons???) and an extra day.... I spoke to Customer service and was shut down on all fronts... The rep was rude and talked over me, wouldnt listen to my complaints and essentially said if you dont like the options, cancel your rental.... I debated with the CS rep what a small SUV is vs a Nissan Kicks.... Its a difference of 80 horsepower and a turbo.... both of these statements were ignored by CS.... and i was essentially told that the capacity matched and its the same ""class"" of car.... I will never use FOX again.... predatory practices and bad customer service.... ",1,US,"July 12, 2024"

My husband signed the contract that said no issues with the car. We get home and on my credit card bill was another additional charge of 16 and 150!

"WORST RENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.Prepaid $582 for a rental only to arrive at the rental counter, wait over an hour, and then be told that no cars were available. If a car is reserved for a specific date and time for pickup, especially when paid for, how is it not ready?Finally, myself and several people in line ahead of me, were walked over to Dollar rental BY THE FOX EMPLOYEE because they had a few cars left. I was told that Fox would reimburse the difference, which I double checked with the Fox employee about before heading to the garage with my new rental agreement from Dollar for $948.Once the car was returned to Dollar, I called Fox to follow up on the reimbursement process only to be told that (A) there was no record in the Fox notes about running out of cars nor the employee promising reimbursement and (B) I should have been given an 'upsell agreement' by Fox which I was not. Now it appears that I am out of luck with reimbursement after paying more than DOUBLE to a competitor under the promise of being made whole by Fox.Not only were the Fox representatives at the SEATAC counter not helpful, they were also incompetent. Calling the customer service line has been just as maddening an experience with no help or guidance given at all.I would sooner walk barefoot to my destination than to rent a car with Fox.",1,US,"July 04, 2024"

"I recently rented with fox - Orlando, after traveling all day and finally making it to my rental agency, i was handed the keys and told to sign a multitude of documents. One that I was told was ""Mandatory"" to sign was the loss damage waiver. I was told by Hakim that this was mandatory as i was renting a 15 passenger van, and it was classified as a commercial vehicle. So standing there with 5 kids my wife and inlaws, i signed. Once i got settle about 2am i called my credit card company which i booked through and they said it is no way mandatory and my travel card has it covered. I called back the billing dept at fox and told them to remove it. They said I could travel back to the rental agency and get it refunded or wait until i return the vehicle and call them back for the refund- i had 72 hours after i returned the vehicle for my refund. I asked them if they made note on my file that i called and requested it to be removed/refunded and they did state that it was clearly on my file. So the day i retuned my vehicle i called the billing dept and they stated they had to escalate this matter - it was escalated and weeks went by i never heard back, after calling a number of times i was told they would get in contact with via email. as another work week went by i called back and they said it was denied by the manager. FOX Rental was by far the most unprofessional company i have dealt with but will never deal with again. I will begin to spread my experience now across the numerous sites for review in hopes to help another travel weary family make a better decision when it comes to the numerous rental companies available !

"Used Fox Rent A Car in Denver CO. Waited in line for 1.5 hrs. After about an hour we were almost to the counter and they announced that anyone in line could pay $20 and jump into the empty ""priority line"" right next to us. Several people closer to the back of the line jumped over there essentially cutting the line for $20. Not wanting to do that to the couple parties in front of us we waited, and waited. The staff was combative and rude when people in line got upset about letting people cut for $20.When we finally got our car it was rough. It had over 50k miles with lots of dings and paint chipped on the exterior. The door wells hadn't been cleaned in weeks and there was a significant hole worn through the carpet under the gas pedal and ""Maintenance Required"" was on the dash display the entire time.And yet we felt lucky to get this car because one person in front of us was still standing outside when we left because they couldn't find her car, and another gentleman was trying to get another car because the previous renter had thrown up in it and Fox hadn't cleaned it in between renting it.

I reserved a full size car, described as a Camry or similar.  When I arrived, the rental agent immediately tried to upsell me on a more expensive car.  I politely declined.  He disappeared for a few minutes and returned with keys to a Nissan Sentra.  I told him that the Sentra is not a full size car.  He replied ""We are out of Camrys.""   I said ""any similar car will do"".  He told me all their full size cars are being washed and prepped and I'd have to wait 45 minutes for one.  Or, I could upgrade for an additional charge.  Clearly this was a pressure tactic.  I was with my grandson and we were both tired from traveling all day.  So I reluctantly agreed to the Sentra.

I was asked to review and sign the charges on a ridiculously small screen and missed that they were overcharging me.    Also, I was misled around the option I had to pay road tolls directly  using the “Pay by Plate” system and was charged $45 for $8 in tolls.      I was successful in getting reimbursement from Europcar for the extra amounts charged, and then a couple of weeks later I have now again been charged extra amounts by Fox Rental and I have to now dispute these charges all over again.    NOTE:  Europcar owns Fox Rentals.      Based on reviews this overcharge model seems to be systematic in their business process to overcharge people and force them to make a claim in a dispute knowing that many people will not notice or just give up.

It started with the abnormally long wait time to get the car. It was the only counter that had a wait, and we soon discovered why. The attendants were chatting with customers regarding favorite TV shows, family lineage, etc even though it was 10pm with an hour and a half line of people waiting. Of course, their computer also encountered a ""glitch"" while we were trying to check in, which made them have to restart their computers. Then, we were deceived into believing that the state of Washington has so many tolls and were convinced to spend $12.99 a day for the toll pass. We didn't even come across a toll in the 6 days we were there while driving over 1000 miles. They will not refund the money. Finally, my son left his Nintendo Switch in the car and the parking attendant called and told us he had it, and that we needed to email lost and found to get it. We have not heard back in over a week, and when I try to call to check on it...my call gets directed to the Philippines where they have no access to anyone in Seattle. There is LITERALLY no way to get in phone contact with the Seattle branch. This was a very sketchy experience. ",1,US,"June 14, 2024"
They are terrible. I can't even modify my reservation because my flight has been changed. I'm out almost $300 now and my bank won't touch it. SCAM. Complete and utter SCAM.,1,PK,"June 24, 2024"
Good service ,4,US,"January 05, 2024"
First and last time renting for Fox Rent A Car.  Horrible customer service.  They won't explain to you that you prepay for gas and that there is no reimbursement for gas thats left in the tank when you return the car.  Apparently you are supposed to putter into the parking lot on empty.  Rude customer service rep.  There are plenty of other options for. car rental companies...go elswhere ,1,US,"June 04, 2024"
"BEWARE. Used Booking.com for 4-day rental at listed price of $170. Reserved this car specifically because it was listed as a Jeep Cherokee (or similar). When I got to Fox Rental counter at Phoenix Airport, I was told the car size I rented was NOT valid for a Jeep. Then they added another $82 in hidden 'taxes and fees' to the Booking.com rental price. Instead of $170 the real cost was $252. Deceptive advertising, surly counter staff, and A/C in Nissan Rouge I ended up with couldn't handle the 112F daytime heat. Booking.com didn't allow me to give Fox Rental Cars a Review on their site, so I'm leaving one here.",1,US,"June 16, 2024"
"Horrible customer service. I tried to modify my reservation and talked to the chat bot and with someone over the phone, neither of whom could assist me. I would highly discourage anyone from renting a vehicle from this company in the event you have to make changes or need any help in general. I was told the only person who could modify the reservation was the location manager, in this case in Denver but neither the online chat nor the “customer service” call center could give me their number which made that time spent useless.

Fox has our money for a prepaid car rental in Vegas Confirmation # FFX04726C8 — they refused to give us a car even though we had rented from them numerous times in the past— without any problem — we have tried for the past couple of months to get a refund from either FOX or from DIscover cars who we had booked through.  Vegas slots aren’t the only things that want to keep your money  “GREAT BUSINESS ETHICS “ from both companies —- they both have now refused to communicate or refund !!,1,US,"April 09, 2024"
"BEWARE!!!!! Fox Rental car Austin, TX airport is a SCAM, bate & switch.  They offer a great price for a large vehicle and you pay in advance.  Then, when you get to the rental counter at the AUS airport, they don't have the size you paid for so you either wait until they can find one - over 2 hours or you take a smaller vehicle with NO discount in rate.  It happened to me on 6/6 and it happened to my son on 6/7.",1,US,"June 06, 2024"
"First of all, we've always liked Fox. Great prices. Good vehicles. Good counter reps. However, if you leave something on their shuttle buses or in their facility - forget it. You might as well thrown it in a trash can. Handbag with purse cell phone and misc ""stuff"" left on shuttle. It's been 10 days, 5 phone calls (only to a central call center - can't call the location directly) with no resolution. By tracking the cell phone - it IS located in their airport rental location. Easy-peazey, right. NOPE. Not with these clowns. Had the same experience before with other rental companies - item sent out cost free within a day. Fox won't even acknowledge that they have the item.",1,US,"May 28, 2024"
"The absolute worst experience of my life. The check engine light came on the car the following morning (post pickup). We call roadside assistance and they told us that it’s probably nothing because the check engine light was not “flashing”. I asked her if they could come bring us a new “working car” since the closet FOX was an hour away from where we were staying and my husband still needed to drive to work. They let us know that if they didn’t see anything overtly wrong we would get charged for the exchange. Later that day my 8-year-old daughter found drug paraphernalia under the drivers seat. The following day the car stalled on highway with three little kids in tow. We tried our best to safely get over and eventually got it running again, but realized there was in fact something wrong with the car. Because the rental is in my husband’s name, he had to exchange the car. He needed the car for a work event in the evening so he had to do the exchange during regular work hours. It took him an hour to get there. He had to wait in the regular line. Then they had difficulty accessing his information (for whatever reason). He was there for over an hour. In all he was gone for about 3.5 hours. My husband works in sales, that is money and time we can’t get back. His boss was not too happy either. In short FOX is okay with US loosing money and time and renting us a lemon with drug paraphernalia in it, but god forbid they do what’s right and bring us working vehicle. When I inquired why they wouldn’t exchange the lemon, their response was because it’s cost them time and money. I guess time and money is only important when it involves their time and money. Absolute worst experience. ",1,N/A,"June 01, 2024"
"I wish I could give them zero stars.First off, I made this reservation 2 months in advance and the car wasn't ready on time, I  had to wait longer for the car to be ready and I get the wrong vehicle. I understand that it is a holiday weekend but you would think that someone that makes a reservation well ahead in advance will get the vehicle that they selected.Second, the customer service at the office is terrible. They come across inconsiderate and definitely seemed like they didn't want to be there. The people that gave me the car didn't listen to my request that I am being given a wrong car. They said that is all they have, as I am looking at an SUV in the lot (they gave me a truck). They added insurance, when I said no.Thirdly, you would think that since I had to wait that the car would be in tip top shape. Well, the inside was not clean and the windshield wiper fluid was low (after 2 uses of it).Go with a known and established rental car company. Do not let the low prices impact your decision. You will definitely save the headache by choosing Hertz or Enterprise. I definitely learned my lesson.",1,US,"May 25, 2024"
Fox rent a car is not handicap friendly They have their entire parking lot fenced off and have you park across the street in another business's parking lot which all of those parking spots are for that business's customers only and it's about a three hundred yard walk from that parking lot to fox's front door which is very difficult for handicap people to do I have filed a complaint with the state as they are not ADA complaint as required by law,1,GB,"May 30, 2024"
"When I arrived at the check-in desk I declined the additional insurance.  The agent ignored that and proceeded to charge it anyway saying it was a ""hold"".  He also helpfully suggested he had activated a Florida Sunpass for me but did not explain that meant I would be charged a fixed daily amount for usage rather than by the toll roads used.  When I complained to the billing department they only produced the paperwork I had signed which I argue was under falsehoods and omissions represented by the agent.  It was a little tough to argue with the location agent since I had two toddlers pulling on me and a long drive ahead of us, meanwhile he was busy playing on his phone between customers.  Furthermore, when I tried to raise a complaint within the organization, they suggested they had ""passed my feedback to the location manager"".  They never apologized for the lies that were told to me or the things that were omitted and they refused to let me speak to the location manager to understand if they actually had received my feedback and instructed their employees to behave more reputably.  I've leaned my lesson and will never use them again nor suggest that anyone does.  I have gone back to mainstream global car rentals and low and behold, they charge me for what they say they will when I make the booking, not additional add-ons under falsehoods and omissions.

"Orbit Car Rental is a third party website which offers cheap car rental.  They will ask for a small deposit which is non refundable.  The company is only contactable via phone or email and is NOT 24 hours.  It’s actually based in the UK.  I booked my Las Vegas rental car through them for Fox Rental car and both were appalling.  Fox Rental were so rude, they have no idea what customer service is.  Not only did Fox tell us they were not able to “scan” my drivers license, they also told us there is nothing they can do to help.  Even though we had 4 other drivers and licenses we could have tried.  Fox just kept saying they can only try the license from the name on the reservation and that I had to call Orbit.  When I tried to call Orbit from Las Vegas, their office was closed.  I did email them to which two days later they responded by saying they can’t help once the reservation time has passed.  I mean - what can I say - your office was closed when I was struggling with Fox Rental.  They can’t give me my deposit back either.  We had no other option but to find another car rental  where we paid higher rates as it was last minute. I would NOT recommend booking with Fox Car Renatl anywhere in the world and definitely NOT in Vegas.  And save yourself the hassle and don’t go through Orbit Car Rental as they won’t help you either and will keep your deposit",1,US,"May 24, 2024"
"Agent lied to upsell toll pass. I specifically told him I wanted no insurance, when I questioned why charge was higher than quote was told it was security deposit. Documentation nonexistent or confusing and after long day at airports and a 45 minute wait for shuttle just wanted to get to my house. My fault for not looking closer. Will never rent from Fox again",1,US,"May 17, 2024"
"Hands down the worst rental experience I have ever had.  They did not have the vehicle I reserved and then up charged for what was left.  They vehicle broke down on the highway.  They told me several different things and then advised that I had to get an Uber from the side of the highway because it worked better to town the vehicle to the repair shop.  They said get to the airport (DFW) to get a new vehicle.  I had to bribe the tow truck driver to actually take me there.  Got to the rental counter and it had been closed for 2 hours (which was before the service told me to go there.  Three other customers came and found it was closed also.  I had to Uber back to the hotel.  In the morning they called and said the new vehicle would be there in 25 minutes, after an hour and 10 minutes it showed.  When I dropped off the vehicle, I tried to speak with them about the incident, but the counter was so slow and backed up, I would have missed my flight.  Very poor customer service and vehicle.  Rent from some one else!",1,NL,"May 18, 2024"
"Via carrental8.com I rented a car with Fox rent a car for 3 weeks with a pickup in Salt Lake City and a return in Los Angeles. Because of the time difference the initial starting date was one day early. Luckily one week upfront I discovered it and could chat with Fox customer service. They we're very helpful and they changed the starting date. On arrival the fox agency in SLC told me that I was one day late and the car was already gone. My upfront payment of $450  was gone and they only could rent me one of their most expensive cars for $ 1700. They claimed that the cs rep was not working for Fox and that the local agency had their own policy. I've copy's of the chats with the Fox employees, but they didn't care about it, because they knew they got me hooked......",1,CA,"April 28, 2024"
"STAY AWAY!  Looked online for an inexpensive rental with unlimited mileage.  Fox at Toronto Pearson Airport provided one. Booked. Arrived and had to follow a maze of instructions to find the landline to get a shuttle - it did not work!!  Had to use my mobile to get a shuttle and had to call twice.On arrival was told I had to make a $1,000 deposit on my credit card which they took a photocopy of!!  Even though I was using my personal vehicle insurance I was told I had to pay $6.00/day for ""Transfer Feed"" - what the heck is that!!  Then when signing contract told I had a 3,000 kilometer limit on my ""unlimited mileage"" advertised offer!!! So, the cost of the rental when up almost 40%!  They gave us a black vehicle when it was dark out and you could not see if there were any scratches etc.The next day when I tried to contact them I as told to send an email and the manager would respond.  They gave me the wrong email - twice!!  I finally left a message for someone to contact me, not one contact in three weeks.On return was told I had to detail the car as they say dog hair in it - I DO NOT HAVE A DOG AND NO DOG RODE IN IT!  If I didn't detail the car they would charge me a detailing fee.  I had to find a gas station with a vacuum because they would not let me use theirs!!!They are deceitful in their advertising, hidden costs everywhere, no customer support - STAY AWAY, STAY AWAY. Where they get their positive reviews is beyond me!!!",1,US,"April 24, 2024"
I rented a car from Fox in San Diego a couple years ago and the agent lied to me saying my Amex didn't cover the loss of use portion of the insurance.  It was late so I couldn't call Amex.  After I called and complained and they wouldn't refund my card.  Openly lying agent and I'm screwed out of $150.,1,US,"May 12, 2024"
Worst company ever!!! Picked up a car after a long flight and was told under state law I had to purchase insurance that I later found out was not true. Very deceiving. Stay away!!,1,US,"April 30, 2024"
The representative that checked me in at DFW was outstanding. I believe her name is Rosalia. She was very helpful and friendly. She offered me an upgrade and I took it. It was supposed to be a Jeep Grand Cherokee. When I got to the car area the man “helping” me was in a big hurry and didn’t even show me where the keys were. Instead of the Jeep I paid an upgrade for I received a Dodge SUV. Also the wait to get checked in was about an hour. ,3,US,"May 08, 2024"
"Thief’s, military vet overcharged by $250. I am retired military vet with a trained service animal to assist with walking. I was told by a fox employee to not worry about the little hair that was left and that they appreciate my service. 2 days later there are over $250 in charges for hair. Fox is a corrupt company that will steal anyway possible. ",1,US,"March 28, 2024"
"We rented a Hyundai Santa Fe in Orlando last week.  Nice car, but brutal customer service.  Everything is good until you have a problem, and then you have a problem.  You can't reach anyone on the phone.  You are encouraged to write to Fox on line...where it says it will be answered in up to 72 hours. Great.  I finally reached them when I got home, and they didn't give a damn.  They just seem to not care.",1,US,"May 04, 2024"
"I reserved and paid for a full size SUV.  When I arrived in Burbank to pick it up, Fox said they only have small crossovers.  I am 6’5” and my son is 6’7”.   We specifically reserved a larger automobile.   The employee at the desk said he has 24 people with reservations and only 12 cars, so I am lucky to get anything.  I told him this was a major inconvenience and they should at least give a discount.  He said he could not.  I called their customer service and they said they won’t do anything.  Lots of mad customers. ",1,US,"May 03, 2024"
"Watch out for tolls. They don't provide a toll reader and discouraged me from getting one, then I got charged for the 3 tolls PLUS $15 PER TOLL (yes, PER TOLL) ""admin fee"". The company that collects the fee (called FoxTollsAndFines, yes entire company based on that!!) denied they charge the fee and said I need to call Fox. Conveniently, Fox insisted that it's not them, even though the collection letter refers to the ""Rental Agreement"". ",1,US,"April 30, 2024"

Everything worked as expected. No surprises. Really good price. Shuttle service was about 10 minutes. The nice lady at the desk refused to speak at a volume loud enough to hear her. Otherwise would be 5 star.,4,US,"April 28, 2024"
I flew into ORD went to pu my pre reserved vehicle . The counter folks said the scanner could not read my license even though TSA on multiple flights had no issue with the bar code . They denied me renting . I tried the agency right next to them same issue . They said they all used the same reader . Stuck at Ohare ,1,US,"May 01, 2024"
Just rented with Fox again in Las Vegas.  Consistently the lowest price offer for the same vehicles.  Quick and easy in and out .I do not remember the last time I  rented with another company.  Fox always comes in lowest priced with good service.,5,US,"April 29, 2024"
"I have rented from Fox for years. I couldn't been happier. However a car rental in Tampa turned sour. They decided to hide,in small print, a Platepass charge when you are declining added insurance. So be very careful. I arrived at midnight so I was not as careful as I should have been.",1,N/A,"April 09, 2024"
"Rented a Jeep from their Ontario CA airport offsite location from 3/21 through 3/28. While picking up the Jeep the Fox representative did the standard up-sale for insurance/gas/toll road options and we optioned to pre-pay for gas and told the rep we had a toll road account and that we would place the vehicle on our account as we knew we would be using the toll roads for an early appointment. The rep made comment about ""if that works"" when I said I'd use my account knowing it wouldn't. What I learned that the toll roads will use the license plate to charge my account UNLESS the car has a transponder associated with an account. The Jeep did have a transponder so Fox was billed where Fox then charges a $15 admin fee for each loop you pass through. If your going to Disneyland from Riverside that is 3 different loops each way. This is their scam. All the reps know the plate will not be scanned, and billed to the customer account, and the customer will get charged $15/scan with a max of $90/day all while I thought the charge is going to my account. THEY ARE SCAMMING CUSTOMERS WHO USE THE TOLL ROADS. They have a whole dept to handle complaints after the fact where you find out the truth. WILL NOT USED FOX AGAIN OR EUROCAR THEIR OWNERS.",1,US,"March 28, 2024"
"As an American citizen, living in Portugal, I needed to get a Portuguese license. Returned to the US to visit family. Got to SeaTac airport and was told by Fox that my car rental reservation was not going to be honored unless I could show an International Drivers Permit. Mind you this was at 11pm and we still, after a 20 hours flight with layovers, had 3 hours to drive. Even two of the other agents, at other desks said that they rented to drivers licenses from other countries all the time (let’s remember that we’re talking about a car rental place at an airport).  Finally gave up, without any refund, and went to another agency that gladly rented me a car. As I was leaving, I passed Fox and showed the agent I’d been dealing with that other agencies were willing to take my business. His response was to say: “**** you!”Why on earth would you do business with these guys???",1,US,"May 08, 2023"
Booked through Expedia. They charged me for 2 extra days even though I didn’t use it for 2 extra days. They blamed Expedia for the error in their system. Didn’t fully refund even after I sent receipt from Expedia. Stay away.,1,US,"April 21, 2024"
"Worse rental car company in the US, used many different companies never had a problem, they lie to you in order to make you purchase insurance. When you arrive to pick up the car they make it almost imposible to take the car without paying for insurance 6 days to here back from a manager after several phone calls. Some of their vehicles are old and not well mantained, never renting a car with Drivo,Ace,Fox they are the same company",1,CA,"April 22, 2024"
"Added a FOX rental to our flight for 5 days in Ft.Lauderdale.  Was quoted $187 US (we are Canadian) and that was a pretty great price.  By the time we were finished at the counter (almost the same amount of time as our actual FLIGHT there!) we were being changed double that plus!  Add this, add that, blah blah blah.  The upsell of the Sunpass is actually a joke and takes advantage of visitors to this area. I get the Rental Car companies are all about upselling, but this is almost robbery. The lineup alone with 2 people working was very very painful. The car was fine, but not worth the price we paid for it.Won't be renting from them again.",1,DK,"April 16, 2024"
"I was charged below too much:- 70usd more than original price- 50usd more for fuel than agreedTheir explanation being taxes, when my renting agreement clearly shows a lower price and states “taxes included”I contacted customer support and got unserious responses without any space in a logical conversation.I never had this problem before with europcar. They are obviously called “fox rent a car” in Los Angeles Airport. Stay away.While waiting for my car during pick up (1 hour) two other customer ended up in a discussion with the personnel. Unbelievable.",1,US,"April 01, 2024"
"This company is cheap, but they get you back by lying.  They blatantly lied about the cost for the toll pass and when I objected at the bill, they said I must have heard them wrong.  My wife and I heard the same thing and I even repeated it back to the representative.  They also added insurance that we did not want.  We were starting a vacation and didn’t read the paperwork carefully enough as we trusted the representative we were dealing with.

This is the worst experience I have ever had from a car rental company I came to PBI  I had reservations for a car got to the counter I was sent to get the shuttle I waited for the bus for about 20 minutes then the driver sent me back to the counter to get a contract went back to the counter and waited for another 45 minutes before a counter  person said he will not rent Me a car and won’t advise me how to get a refund left the incapable guy went to SIXT and got a car in 15 minutes that’s good service ,1,US,"April 10, 2024"
"I am writing to share my recent experience with FOX Rent a Car service at Phoenix Airport, which unfortunately fell short of my expectations.Two months ago, I made a reservation for a full-size SUV for an upcoming April 7th, 2024, trip. However, upon arrival, I was disappointed to find that the vehicle provided was a small Jeep SUV that had a strong smell of smoke. Despite bringing this to the attention of your staff, I was informed that there were no other vehicles available, and I had no choice but to accept the car as is.During my rental period, I encountered further issues with the vehicle, particularly with its gear shifting mechanism. This forced me to return the car and make an additional trip, spending 2 hours out of my way to obtain a replacement. To my dismay, the replacement vehicle was still not the full-size SUV I had reserved.In addition to the vehicle-related issues, I found the level of customer service provided to be well below average. Communication was lacking, and there was a general lack of effort to address my concerns in a satisfactory manner.As a loyal customer, I expected a smoother and more accommodating experience. Unfortunately, my recent rental experience has left me feeling dissatisfied and inconvenienced.I hope that by sharing this feedback, they can take appropriate measures to improve their quality of service they provided to customers. Addressing issues such as vehicle quality and customer service responsiveness can go a long way in ensuring customer satisfaction and loyalty.I sincerely hope to see improvements in the future.",1,LU,"April 07, 2024"

"First time to try them and it’ll be the last.

Fox contacted another rental company and I was told to drive to another location to pick up the van. I had to pay a higher rate, as they did not honor the price I paid with Rentalcars.com so beware! and did not honor the rental coverage for the initial reservation so I had to get another one, again beware!  I was told by the Fox agent that Enterprise will honor my car coverage, just take it there and they will screen shot it, not true!  The refund process between the rental company and rental cars.com is so convoluted (which I never imagine until i actually file a claim). Fox will only pay the difference and the rest will be paid by third party RentalCars.com. I am still fighting to get the money that I paid for!",1,US,"April 04, 2024"

I finally got 5ge type car I rented, The next day I got a low tire light and on investigation Fox had 4 unsafe tires on the car  nothing was open on Sunday I had to wait a day to tires  replaced. This kept me from two days of scheduled events. Because I missed what I came to Arizona for, I returned the car early. Fox would not reimburse me for the unsafe car and would refund me for returning th3 car early! Plus they said I drove 6000 miles and I only put 500 miles on the car.

The windshield wiper fluid was empty, leading to an annoying alert while driving, and most important, while making a 4.5 hour drive back to the rental car location, the car's collision warning system went bad and kept bleeping at us, showing an alert, and resetting. Each time it reset, the car maneuvered strangely. I wrote to the company to tell them of the issues we were having and I, to date, have received no response after several days.

"I booked through Expedia and was quoted a very reasonable price. When I got to the counter in Phoenix the agent told me that he would give me an upgrade for free since he wasn’t busy that day. I signed the contract without looking at it carefully (very tired) and when I got my credit card statement it was for double the price I had  agreed on through Expedia. They charged me the amount of the upgrade and all the incidental taxes and service fees were bumped up too. The agent I talked to was no help at all. Lesson learned, always pay at the time  you book through Expedia. Don’t wait until later.I will never use Fox again.",1,US,"February 09, 2024"
Run. Don’t walk from this place. Book a particular car and then upon arrival not in stock. They want 150 more to upgrade. Booked with nu car in Denver for half the price. Fox car rentals suck. If I can help the next person avoid problems then hopefully this review will do that. ,1,US,"March 05, 2024"
"The desk agent (ATL) indicated at the time of rental that the rental liability insurance was required to rent a car in Georgia. To no avail, I indicated to her that I had a full coverage policy with Allstate.In spite of that, she insisted that I had to purchase the liability in order to rent the car. Not knowing Georgia Law and having no other option as my rental was prepaid, I indeed signed the agreement. Otherwise, I stood to lose the $210 already paid and not having a rental car.Upon reaching my destination, I called your customer service department. The answering rep indicated that I had to drive back to the pick-up location and resolve the issue before returning the car. I asked to speak with his supervisor. I explained to the supervisor that travelling back to the pick-up local prior to my return flight wasn't an option.To her credit, she filed  a complaint that was forwarded to your attention.",1,CA,"January 10, 2024"
"We arrived to the car rental area close to the MCO (Orlando Airport).  The line-up was long.  There were people with children (and it was 11:30pm).  I had an SUV booked (we had to carry four sets of golf clubs).  When I got to the front of the line - I was told that we had two choices:  a Chrysler sedan or a 15-seater bus.  Those were the ONLY two vehicles they had left and there was a line-up of about 10 families behind me. They, of course, tried to upsell everything:  Insurance, Toll packages, etc.  They are slimy, unreliable criminals who should be put out of business.  I ended up booking with Turo.com instead and it was a better deal, and much better experience.  ",1,US,"February 25, 2024"
"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! NO ONE KNOWS what they are doing!!!! This is the worst car rental company I have ever dealt with. I decided to rent from them dues their supposed low rates and picked up a car at Burbank Airport. For starters, they did not provide any clear directions to fin them. Next, the wait was very long as the person in charge seemed to be confused, overwhelmed or maybe just a recently hire employed. Finally, they gave me a set of keys na direct me vaguely to a car but pointing in a general areas. I had to return and ask them where the car was and someone then went over an pointed to one (there were dozens nearby). I got in the vehicle and recognized that the keys did not work. Finally, they found the right car. When I went to return it 5 weeks later, I asked to extend it for 5 days and after I was processed, i looked at the bill and they were going to charge me $1300+ for 5 extra days!!! So, I went back to confront the employee at the desk who was confused as well and then looked at it and said, 'No, you are only being charged some $313.00 which was still expensive but I trusted what he said. Two days later, I got a call from the company and told me that I would have to pay a penalty for keeping the car out longer!!! I responded that their own employee had told me different, this in my response to the email they sent me. I then noted the charge on my credit or debit card for over $1300!! I waited till Monday to call to protest this exorbitant and blatantly insane charge esp. since their own employee had told me different when he clarified the charge for mt to be some $313 or so. Now, for the disaster part! Their call center is staffed by English speakers with a thick accent and it sounded like India. The woman who took my call said she would connect me with someone else since she could not deal with the situation. The next person, a woman, answered and asked me what the situation was and before I could explain, she kept interrupting me and I asked her to stop and listen first but she would NOT!! She kept talking over me rudely and repeatedly and said they had left me  a message (she must have been referring to a call from somebody 2 days after I had extended my reservation (this is when I found out that there was a penalty for taking if 5 more days which they said was because I had gone over 30 days. But I wrote back that I had actually already rented the car for one month plus a week, already beyond the so called 30 day period. The customer service woman was absolutely horrific and had no interest in dealing with me, a customer, in a manner befitting the fact that I was paying for something but now they were clearly ripping me off. Can you imagine charging someone $200 per day for a 'penalty' when the guy at the desk had already processed my request and confirmed the charge was only $313 for 5 more days!!!! The bill was incomprehensible.",1,US,"February 28, 2024"

"FOX Rental Car (Orlando)1) Remote KeyFob didn't work -  Had to use my valuable vacation time to go to Auto Zone to purchase a new battery and install it.2) No windshield wiper fluid -  Had to use my valuable vacation time to go to Auto Zone and purchase washer fluid. I also had to fill the washer fluid reservoir.3) Proximity detection alert did not work - When I made the reservation I asked for a smaller SUV. Instead, the pickup agent only offered me a large Toyota 4Runner and said this would be better to drive. No, it wasn't. Especially harder to maneuver without the proximity alert.4 Liftgate auto-open with KeyFob did not work (even after battery replaced !!)5) Pickup agent was dishonest re: tolls - He told us that Florida's toll system was not convenient for visitors to the state. He said that if we didn't get the Tolls PlatePass that we would need to stop at every toll plaza and pay by cash (and some toll stations didn't have the cash option), else we would be ticketed and fined $300 per incident. He said there were no other options. After the fact, we found out that a Florida Visitor Toll Pass was available via a FREE App, so that we could get a toll sticker at the airport and only pay the amount Floridians pay for tolls. We were charged $103 for the week. I called other rental companies and they charge ~$70 per week, with no additional fees. In a nutshell, what Fox does is unethical.All of the above was discussed with the manager on 2/18/24 at Fox Rental-Orlando when I returned the car. The money I spent on the KeyFob battery and washer fluid was credited on the bill by Fox roadside assistance. The manager at the rental location only compensated me $40 for the aggravation and time I had to spend on my vacation dealing with all of this.I reserved with Fox because they had the best deal, but was very disappointed with the experience.If I could give '0' stars, I would.",1,US,"February 18, 2024"

I renter a car for business in Atlanta-harried airport recently. Only one person at desk and nearly an hour wait. I said I would return car full of gas only to find out the rep charged me for pre-payment of fuel.Unable to resolve the issue.I understand from colleagues this seem happen to them and they all switched to other rental agencies.I will say their cars were clean but ours smelled like a cigar.My next two weekly trips I went with a national brand and received quick personal service and a clean car with a flawless rental.,2,US,"November 22, 2023"
"Not happy with the rental. Car was OK, but received a wealth of misleading (mistruths) Information. 1) when I picked up the car at LAX I explicitly asked if I needed a transponder for tolls. ‘Are you going to San Diego?’  No I said. ‘Then you don’t need one. Be happy to rent you one, but you won’t need one.’  That’s incorrect. I did incur tolls on the trip to Carlsbad. Got billed and had a significant administrative fee.  Fox wouldn't respond to my inquiry.  2) Also, when I picked the car up the clerk said I could bring the car back less than full and they would ‘top it off’ at (approximately) $4.80 per gallon. They explicitly said ‘you don’t need to stop next door’—the gas station was right next to the pick up center. I therefore didn’t. Returned it 3/4 full. Told the guy that they told me they would top it off at $4 something. He said that’s not exactly right. They are going to charge you $51 to fill it. I asked why?  ‘That’s just what they do’. This was 5:30 in the morning and I was running late. Explicitly mislead twice. Purposely. Responded to Fox when they invited me to fill out a survey and never heard back from them.  When I tried to actually fill out the survey they sent me, it had been cancelled.  Obviously didn't want my responses made public.  Very poor, misleading service.",1,US,"January 19, 2024"

"There must have been a different customer service class that all the Fox employees take in Orlando. My favorite part was the shuttle driver (I believe his name is Rodrigue M.) Last time I was in Orlando, I had a bad experience with a different car rental, and this caribbean man (Fox shuttle driver) overheard us and told us about FOX rental. He sold us this rental car and how great they are and told us we would not regret renting from them. And he was definitely right. This time when I came to Florida, I rented from FOX and We loved it. Car was great. Customer service from the entire team was phenomenal. And luckily for us this driver was the one that dropped us off at the airport on our way home. He did not remember our previous encounter, but I thanked him anyway and told him as far as Orlando FOX rental, they forever made a customer out of me with services like this.",5,CA,"January 24, 2024"

The charge came to an extra $129 for our rental, and afterwards I calculated our tolls on the FL Turnpike site... it came to $0.81 for one particular day of travel.

I paid £294 for a car from fox with $118 to pay on collection.  I said no to the extra insurance on collection but still got charged $747.  They claimed the insurance I had just covered the inside of the car and I couldn't have the car without paying it.  If I had known this I would have gone elsewhere as it was a significant chuck out of my holiday money.  An option should be optional not mandatatory.

"I recently had the misfortune of renting a car from Fox Rent a Car during a trip to Miami, and I feel compelled to share my nightmarish experience. From start to finish, the entire process was marred by deception, poor customer service, and a blatant disregard for customer satisfaction.My troubles began at the pickup counter, where a representative forcefully pushed additional services on me, falsely claiming they were mandatory. Despite my clear refusal, I found myself coerced into purchasing insurance and a PlatePass, causing my reservation total to skyrocket. This bait-and-switch tactic not only soured the beginning of my vacation but also left me questioning the integrity of Fox Rent a Car.Upon realizing the misrepresentation, I reached out to the manager the next day seeking a refund or an option to return the car. Instead of addressing the issue, I was told returning the car would cost me $350 early return fee (the total amount in the original booking), which was extremely unfair given the circumstances. The manager conveniently failed to mention that the insurance is only mandatory if the driver lacks personal insurance – information that would have influenced my decision not to purchase it.Despite reaching out to the operations manager via email and filing a claim with the Consumer Protection Office of Miami-Dade County, Fox Rent a Car has shown a blatant lack of concern for customer grievances. The operations manager's response was dismissive and unhelpful.This entire experience has left me thoroughly dissatisfied with Fox Rent a Car's deceptive practices and abysmal customer service. I would strongly advise anyone considering their services to think twice and explore alternative options. Fox Rent a Car's lack of transparency, disregard for customer concerns, and refusal to rectify the situation have left me with a bitter taste and an unwavering determination to share my experience to spare others from a similar fate.In conclusion, my recommendation is clear: steer clear of Fox Rent a Car unless you're willing to risk a ruined trip and a severe dent in your wallet. There are countless reputable car rental companies out there, and Fox Rent a Car is undoubtedly not one of them.",1,US,"January 06, 2024"

Never use FOX or EuropeCar!I booked a car via Rentalcars with all possible insurances but yet to face no other choice than to accept to purchase same insurance at my destination or no car. In fact they said it’s nothing to do with them despite my booking. The total amount for my rental ended to be almost three times the value compared to my initial booking with same coverage. Rentalcars are aware of this trick and write upon booking the following: “At the rental desk you will be offered an equivalent product to this one but it will less inclusions and it will cost twice the price. With your protection you can say “no” to the hard sell for collision damage waivers or similar excess reduction products at the pick up desk - you’re already protected”. Wrong!!!,1,US,"January 22, 2024"
This was my first time renting a car from an airport service. It was super easy. The line was a bit long at pickup. Roughly 25 mins.  They gave me a free upgrade to the luxury class!  I got a 2023 Chrysler 300S with only 4K miles. It was fun playing with all the tech and integration for 11 days and it only cost 235 bucks. After reading a few 1 star reviews I wanted to add some info about my payment experience. I prepaid the rental with my mom’s debit card on Expedia. I used my credit card for the 150.00 deposit. They only held the funds for about 7 days before releasing the deposit(while I still had the car for 3 more days). They tried to upsell insurance and refueling. I declined both and didn’t pay an extra cent. I refueled for 3.50/g they offered to do it for 4.30. I spent 4 bucks at the self car wash vacuuming the muddy carpets and hosing off 10 days of mud and snow before I dropped it off. The guy walked around the car and said I’m good. They emailed me a receipt within 10 mins that said I owe nothing more. 235 for 10.5 days. 400 miles cost me 70 bucks in fuel.,5,CA,"January 18, 2024"

"It was a very good car.  The interior of the car could have been a little bit cleaner, especially the seats, but it was okay.  Relatively easy pickup and dropoff.  This was my second time, and there is always a little bit of waiting to pickup the car as they are busy, which is understandable.  Overall, good experience, and I will continue to rent from them.  If they read this review, one suggestion I have is to provide insurance at a better rate.  There is an insurance you can purchase online that is over $10 less expensive but it is through a 3rd party.  It would make it easier to just get the insurance from FOX for only a couple of $ more.  Thank you,",5,US,"January 19, 2024"

Terrible! Fox Car Rental deserves to be out of business. I used my Visa card to make a pre-paid reservation for a mid size car at Dallas international Airport through Expedia. Upon arrival I was denied the rental because the same visa card that I used for the pre-paid rental was also a debit card. It has two functions as a Visa Credit and a bank debit card in one card. But the employee there had never heard of it and refused to even try to run my Visa card. I was just flat out rejected and told that I’d lose my deposit.  Refund was declined. Expedia escalated the case and said they were wrong but yet Fox car rental does not care. They don’t care about their customers. They just took the money and was heartless about it.,1,US,"January 16, 2024"

"Right from shuttle pickup/drop off, Rental office customer service, Car condition etc, everything extremely satisfied.

No matter what, I will go with Fox Rental again & I recommend others too.",4,CA,"January 10, 2024"

"The pick up time at the airport took over 1/2 an hour, the agent at the rental car location was very nice but did not explain the charge clearly- Example: toll device I was tols was $12.95 not $12.95 per day. Also I was told gas would be $2.99 per gallon if I did not fill the tank- not that you were billing me for a full tank @ $2.99 per gallon no matter what. I beleive bothe of these items were deceptive and misleading.",3,US,"January 05, 2024"
"My spouse and I are very happy with the rented vehicle assigned to us. Amber always made sure we were taken care of. She and other people at Fox always goes above and beyond to accommodate all customers for all the years we've been renting from them. Marcus is the head manager, an outstanding person, and happy to help customers. As I have stated before, Amber made sure we were taken care of. She and Genesis, and the rest, are all happy and eager to help us. My spouse and I have been renting from Fox Rental Car since 2015 and have always been satisfied with Fox and its people. With Fox, you'll never feel abandoned because they are always there to accommodate customers for pick ups and returns unlike other rental companies.

"After being forced to buy insurance by the person at the counter (even after I had said I was using my credit card and she acknowledged that), I got home and went onto their website to chat. The rep confirmed that no insurance was required. I literally said, ""So she basically lied to get extra money out of me."" He replied ""Yes."" He told me to GO BACK to the airport to get them to take it off. That he couldn't do it. I found that hard to believe and really didn't feel that it was my responsibility to go back there, pay to park, get into a confrontation with the manager (read other reviews) to fight for something that they never should have forced upon me.I read the Google reviews of this place and had, within a few hours, written to the email address provided in all of the responses (they say give them 48 hrs to respond). I included the chat, a few screenshots of others saying how they had been forced to buy insurance and I gave them 6 days to respond before writing this. They have not written back.The woman at the counter was not very polite to begin with, talked fast, made me agree to purchase insurance before continuing on with the rental (saying it was MANDATORY). When I showed her my receipt asking to show me where it said that, she said: ""The total at the bottom is an estimate...because you didn't choose insurance."" I had paid up front for the rental.By the way, this is the first place I've come across that does not put a HOLD on your card for the deposit...they CHARGE you for it. And even though I have returned the car 2 days ago, of course I haven't gotten the refund yet. I'm sure they do this so when they screw you on the ""mandatory"" insurance, it's one way they get their money. Then they only refund you the ""difference"" which in my case is NOT the $150 but the amount of the ""mandatory"" insurance as well.So if the company is going to respond to me saying email them, check your email because it's been sitting there since Wednesday. And stop forcing people to buy your insurance which credit cards or personal insurance already cover. It's just bad business and you've lost another customer.",1,GB,"January 04, 2024"

"DO NOT RENT FROM FOX!!!  This is twice, i say twice that fox has done me dirty.  First i waited in line for three hours to get to counter in Orlando.  When i got there i was told they had NO CARS.  Let me wait for HOURS. Had to go to Hertz.I was foolish enough to try again in ft. myers.  Made my reservation, paid it in full, paid for ""cancel for any reason"" and made my reservation.  I had to cancel for health reasons and did so. Waited on refund that never came.  Tried calling and emailing with no reply.  Tried a chat and was told there to call another number.  Got thru and was then told it cost me $150.00 to cancel!  DO NOT rent from them EVER!  I think i learned my lesson.  They would have kept all my  money if I didnt keep trying!!!!!",1,US,"January 09, 2024"

"Looking at the location I initially hesitated to book a car here, but I was wrong. Plus: 1. Fox shuttle service to and from Airport Car Rental service area is for every 5 to 10 mins. We reached the LV Airport Car Rental Service center at 1:00 am. I did not call the Fox rental, but their shuttle came exactly at 1:05 am to pick any passenger to Fox Rental location. Not sure, if they know the flight timing. While returning the car around 3:30 AM, their shuttle service took us back to the Airport Car Rental service center. Again it was only a 5 mins wait. They have multiple shuttle service van, which runs continuously. Point is, do not worry about the shuttle service from FOX rental to Airport rental center2. I was given a brand new car with no license plate. Went there the next day to exchange it with another car having license plate, as I had to travel to SFO. With no hassle they swapped it3. I did a prepaid thru Expedia. $30 was charged to my card after my rental. Called the customer care with a 1 min wait time. The billing was corrected as it was a prepaid. No penny was charged apart from my prepaid.4. Though the location of this rental is in bit outskirts, the compound is safer. Once you are in the location, its safe. The staff just waits for you to drop the car and the checkout process is on the spot though it was 3:30 AMFox rental will be my goto place next time.  Minus:1. During the daytime the place is very crowded. May be Christmas time and flight arrival time. It was a long line with less staffs. May be once in a while and depends on the timing.2. Its bit outskirts and the roads to this rental location is dark. I would recommend dropping the family and luggage at the airport and then drop the car if its midnight. Nothing to worry, but for a safer side, incase.",5,US,"December 30, 2023"

So, I rented again and he upgraded from a Rav4 to a Cherokee because the first had bad tires. Everything was so quickly and easy. I'm just grateful I had this person to help me out.

When I finally got down to the garage to get my car, that guy was awesome and helpful!  He let me choose my car (mid-size sedan is what I booked, he was going to hook me up with a Camry but I asked for the Altima instead).  The car was clean, the tank was full.  He gave me paperwork and told me to hang on to it so I stuck it in glovebox.  I would rent from them again, they were the most reasonable out of all the agencies.",5,US,"December 18, 2023"
Cheap but they hit you with fees you don't agree to. Make sure you know what you are signing for- even though you are doing that on a 2 inch by 3 inch square. Service was okay- the garage people didn't really want to break away from conversations they were having with other workers to help you.

"On a scale from 1-10 my score would be about a 7+. The biggest problem I had with Fox Rent-A-Car Oakland airport was that it took over an hour to get my car in a line of two people ahead of me. This was in the middle of the week, mid morning with two counter agents working when the rental car center wasn’t busy. I don’t know what was going on with a couple of people at the counters that were having some obvious rental issues with documentations or what have you but an hour in line was just unacceptable especially for myself and one other customer who I was speaking with that had Prepaid reservations. Once I got my car, I was totally satisfied with the vehicle. Everything was OK but still one hour in line was just unacceptable with no explanation or apology give. The rate that I paid for my car was great and the vehicle was great. At one point in time, I was almost ready to go to another car rental agency that had no wait time, moving people from the counter to their cars in around 10 minutes or less. My suggestion to Fox at Oakland Airport Rent-A-Car Center is to have an express lane for people with reservations so they won’t have to endure an hour long wait when there’s only two people in line.",3,US,"December 19, 2023"

"I know the holidays are a crazy time for all travel related companies and did I sense that with Fox.  The crowded shuttle and lines of people minutes before closing.  But I was assisted quickly and with a smile.  I was offered an upgrade to an Audi for an additional price, it was almost double of what I had booked but thought, why not it's Xmas.  The representative who helped me was almost more excited than I was.  The car was a dream!  Made my LA experience a true LA Experience!  Thanks Fox!  I shall return again for sure!!",5,US,"December 21, 2023"
"The front counter clerk only saw my daughter and myself and assumed that small SUV would accommodate us. Which itself was an upgrade but the trunk space was too small for the three large pieces of luggage that we had plus a family of 5. I went back to tell the young lady at the key counter this and she upgraded us again to a larger SUV that could accommodate my family and our luggage. She even provided me with lotion cause my hands were extra ashy. Upon inspecting my rental, I remembered that I left my backpack in the other rental car and had to go back to the counter. Of course, she unlocked it.  I never did get her name, but she deserves a shoutout for her exceptional customer service.",5,US,"December 20, 2023"

"I missed my pickup by 3 hours due to a flight delay and didn’t get the car I requested. However, the customer service I received made up for it.I felt the lady that helped me was genuinely apologetic, explaining the issue (not enough cars) and worked hard to get the issue resolved. When I returned my car it was a bit hectic with cars backing up, but it makes sense since they were understaffed that day. Even then, they were calm and professional. The man that drove the shuttle was very attentive and got me on board really quickly. The car was great, the packages for gas and toll were fair. The only issue and reason for 4 stars,was there was only one paper car mat and it lasted two days before it wasn’t useable. It was raining non stop during my trip, I had to use paper towels to keep the floor clean. Otherwise, it was a great experience!",4,US,"December 24, 2023"
"Car and rental experience was great. Shuttle service specially those with heavy luggage(s), need Fox to find a way to get those luggages into the shuttle easier than what it is right now (no help provided when its more than 25 lbs).",4,US,"December 30, 2023"

"The process of renting was pretty good. The price was good, pickup was fine. The Return took me by surprise. When we returned the car. The attendant took out a Flashlight and spent 10 mins going over the car. She pointed out about 12 scratches and smudges she said wasn't on the pre-inspection form when I picked up the car. Told her I was unaware that normal scratches from driving were part of the pre-inspection. Now I know.",2,US,"December 29, 2023"

"Despite making a reservation for a specific car at an agreed-upon rate, I was informed at the counter that the requested vehicle was not available. This resulted in an unplanned upgrade, accompanied by an additional charge of $60 for three days.The representative I interacted with displayed an indifferent attitude and insisted on payment, regardless of the inconvenience caused by the unavailability of the initially reserved car. Moreover, there was a notable discrepancy in the rental period. Despite picking up the car at 10:30 am, I was instructed to return it by 01:00 on the 29th, which doesn't align with a full three-day rental.This experience fell short of the service standards I expected from Fox. I hope that the company can address these issues promptly to prevent similar situations for future customers.",2,US,"December 26, 2023"

"The lines are shorter at pick up than the other major carriers. You must have a credit card and enough on your limit to be charged a $500.00 fee upfront.You must  have this card with you at pick up and Not a debit card. Don’t use a third party vendor (such as Priceline), as they will allow you to make a reservation with the debit card, then when you get to the counter, you will need a credit card. They will also charge you a fee, that you can save by booking directly at the Fox site. I saw this happen to a poor soul who was ahead of me at the pick up counter. After waiting to get to the counter, he had to find out they don’t take a debit card and be turned away to the other car rentals that take a debit card.  Go to the Fox site to reserve your car and all the policies are there. The return policy is odd at my location, where when you arrive, you just park it in returns and leave the keys and go. For me this caused an issue, and the receipt emailed showed a different return time than my actual return time. I was then charged for being late. This was after standing in line for 10 minutes at the return kiosk, only to be told, “leave the keys and go”, once it was my turn at the window. On a previous return, there was a staff member there taking keys and not checking the car at all. So, the idea is they will hit you on your bill if there is something wrong, and in my case, I was charged for being 1 minute late (their time), which was annoying, since I was 10 minutes early. Other than those issues, it is a pretty reasonable price when you book directly.  I saved about $50.00 off the price by booking directly with Fox.",4,US,"December 28, 2023"

"San Diego location was easy to find, quick and easy to go from counter to getting into my car.  I requested a van that would hold 6, and that is what I got, a Pacifica that was really great for ALL passengers.  I mention this because last year I went thru a competitor and ordered a van for 6...they gave me an SUV which was terribly difficult for my elderly father to get into, not all seats were comfortable....it was a bad experience.  I was so hoping that did not happen again, and THIS YEAR WAS GREAT.  Everything about this rental experience was fabulous!",5,US,"December 19, 2023"
"We traveled during the holidays and even though it was very busy the check out process was quick. Note of advice- take your time and inspect the car for cosmetic and mechanical issues.  Look at the windshield and tires. Most these rental places are located in a parking deck which makes it hard to see blemishes so, TAKE YOUR TIME AND TAKE PICTURES.  You have been warned.",5,N/A,"December 18, 2023"

"I was charged a $150 deposit fee despite having paid the full price for the car rental in July (more than 4 months in advance),  I have never been asked to pay a deposit fee when having already remitted full payment before, unless I had possession of property that belonged to the entity to whom I remitted the deposit fee.  I had no possession of property belonging to Fox from late July when I made the payments, until I picked up the car on December 12, 2023.  The deposit fee should not have been charged until I picked up the vehicle.  When I paid the rental fee in full and more than four months in advance I had already made a deposit to secure the rental.",4,US,"December 12, 2023"

This car rental experience couldn't have been any easier.  There is a bit of a walk to the pickup area but totally fine.  The staff is friendly and courteous.  We received a free upgrade from a compact car to a full-size car without a request.  I would use Fox/Euorpe car again without hesitation.,5,US,"December 22, 2023"
The car was very nice. The people who worked there were very awesome! The part that I was not happy with. Was the car was not clean? The windows were very dirty. I had to actually clean them myself!!!  I had called the company. I was having trouble with one of the tires. It kept losing air. They told me they were going to call me back. They never did!!!!! The chances are I will use them again because the rate that I got was very good.,4,US,"November 29, 2023"
"The car had half a tank of gas in it. I returned the car with 3/4 of a tank but they charged me $52 because they state it was full when I picked it up. The girl that returned my call when I disputed the charge was hostile and very rude. Needless to say, I didn't get a refund.",1,US,"December 26, 2023"
"FOX car rental always has late model vehicles for a value rate. Their LDW ( lost damage waiver) insurance is priced smartly as well.  BEST TO PRE PAY rentals with FOX, this allows a separate card for incidentals ( LDW, possible deposit) on a 2nd card if needed. I recommend FOX in LAX, SAN, PHX and Jacksonville,FL.  May I  suggest you call 800 res office after confirmed to go over any costs that are not itemized or calculated at booking (if u use Priceline or a OTA)",5,US,"December 19, 2023"

"I rented a car for a week with Fox from an airport location. The selection of cars were limited and their fleet looked older than what I was expecting. The car I got didn’t have basic features like blind spot detection which I thought was standard for care sold in the last few years. The car also was due for maintenance and started giving me warnings during my trip. If I rent with Fox again, I will pay attention to the condition of the car before driving out of the lot.",3,US,"December 24, 2023"

"There were 4 people in front of me. It took 45 min. for her to get through 5 people. You have WAY too much paper work especially for a car that has already been reserved and paid for. That should have been a 2-3 minute process at the max. You need a covered carport with lights for your person at the gate doing the walk around. There was no way for either of us to see any previous damage on the vehicle in the dark. He also needs to have some basic tools, rags, paper towels and cleaner with him for missed areas the other people may have missed.  My rental and all of the others that I looked at had filthy windows. I had to pull over and find a paper towel to clean the windshield because the of the glare. You can see where they had sprayed water or something at the top of all the windows and just let it run down. They had not been wiped at all. Several people in my party commented on them. It wasn't just that one vehicle either. All of the ones I looked at were like that. You may need to have a class on how to detail a vehicle for your cleaning people.",3,US,"December 16, 2023"

Over all not to bad this time . I use Fox a lot and will keep using them . Sometimes it takes a bit to get picked up at the airport but that is what it is . I think they should have more people working at checking people in at night because there is always a line and only 1 or 2 people working . Over all I like Fox and you can’t beat there prices.,4,US,"December 18, 2023"

Have used Fox twice now.  Happy with service and cars.  Was nervous but no longer.,5,US,"December 15, 2023"
"Great service, relatively quick given that the LA location is busy. The only issue that I've experienced is that the communication/process for a small incident (rock to windshield) is NOT consistent between their roadside assistance and Fox procedures. Roadside assistance insisted I had to repair the vehicle before turning it in, costing me time and money (that I will get back with AMEX rental coverage). I turn it in and guess what... I didn't have to repair it myself, I could of exchanged it. But I couldn't get a hold of the location to ask the question and when I did get a hold of someone through their online chat, they referred me to roadside assistance... so either way it would have ended up the way that it did. I'm getting my money back, but just frustrating that I wasted time due to a lack of guidance and clarity from both Fox and their roadside assistance. BUT, in all other aspects, they were a pleasure doing business and was really quick in getting me a vehicle at a great price in the area. 4 stars for the lack of guidance/runaround but great in-person service/speediness. I hope that this serves as warning to people renting that a small incident (like rock to windshield) you don't have to spend your limited time to repair, but can exchange or drop off.",4,CA,"December 16, 2023"

"Having booked through a independent website the difference between what I expected to pay and what I ended up paying was astronomical. Yes, I expect to pay for some add on extras but not that much. To add insult to injury having used some toll roads Fox charged me $15 dollars admin fee for each Toll. With 22 tolls ($47) that would have been $330 but they kindly only charged me for 6 costing $90. When queried the standard response 'Terms and Conditions' apply was the response",1,US,"November 29, 2023"

"Initially, I had some reservations about choosing Fox Rental Car due to their location being further away compared to other rental services. The journey to reach them was a bit longer than expected, and admittedly, we did experience a delay in getting our car. However, these initial inconveniences were quickly overshadowed by the quality of service and vehicle we received.The car was not only in excellent condition, but it was also impeccably clean and had a pleasant interior scent. Although we didn’t need the car for an extended period, it provided us with a seamless and comfortable travel experience, which was particularly important as we were traveling with a child.I was especially impressed with the efficiency and ease of the car return process. The staff were commendable in their patience and clarity while explaining the refund process. The communication was straightforward and transparent, and we appreciated the reasonable refund we received on our credit card for the unused gas.Overall, our experience with Fox Rental Car turned out to be very positive. Their attention to vehicle quality and customer service has made us happy customers. We’d like to extend our thanks to the team for their professionalism and for making our travel experience smooth and enjoyable.",5,GB,"December 15, 2023"

Our party was separated because the airline changed our ticket, some of us were obliged to stay being one day, they would not add a driver to our rental, they said they did not have the car size they rented to us, and even though I was on the line explaining the situation they would not help us. We will NEVER be using this company. I didn’t see how awful reviews they had before I reserved the car, or I wouldn’t have made a reservation, if they have a five star at all I am sure it’s false advertisement!!!",1,US,"December 20, 2023"
Everyone was nice.  The pick up and drop off went smoothly.,5,PR,"December 15, 2023"

There was a long line up when we arrived and proceeded slowly. The agent we had seemed a bit bored and did not smile. Directional signage could be improved for both getting the car and returning it. Check out was quick and efficient at the counter. The car itself was very good and the whole process was acceptable. Thank You.,4,US,"December 10, 2023"

"I was apprehensive about renting from Fox due to reviews from other locations.  However, according to Expedia, the Fox location in Phoenix had better levels than Budget, etc.  That being said, the experience at the registration counter was great.  When we arrived to the vehicle pickup location there was nobody in the booth.  We headed to the spot number we were given to pickup our minivan.  There was two to choose from.  One of the Fox team showed up and we made our selection from the two vehicles.  I always take a video of the exterior and interior of the vehicles I rent for my records.  There were quite a bit of door creases, panel dents and dings on the vehicle.  Obviously they don't affect the driveability of the vehicle, but never the less it looks bad!  The vehicle had over 77,000 miles on it, again not a big deal, but it seems like a lot of miles for a rental.  Here is where I had issues with the vehicle.  Upon opening the tailgate we found that the trunk area well carpet was missing, there was an absolute ton of dog hair inside the vehicle.  Luckily none of us have allergies to dog!  The inside of the vehicle front windshield was horrendous!  The amount of dirt, haze and film were unbelievable.  When driving facing the sun it was difficult to see out the window! To top it off, when we left the rental car garage we left the facility and found that the back two tires were low on air to the point that the car was warning us about it!  I had to go fill up the back tires which cost me $5 to get air from a convenience machine.  Honestly, the pricing was good, but cleanliness is important regardless of the price paid for the rental.",4,US,"December 09, 2023"

Easy pick up and drop off with shuttle to the airport… Staff was great to work with and Marcus was top notch.  The car was very clean on the inside/out and looked great but the windows I had to be clean myself due to being covered in grime and driving into the sun or at night with glare made it difficult…,4,US,"December 16, 2023"
"My flight was already delayed and also took a while taxiing to the gate so when I finally got to Fox rental place, it was closed while others were opened.  I didn't received any phone call so I had to Uber to my hotel and Uber back to airport that morning. I pre-paid so they guarantee my reservation 12 hours after my current reservation.  I got there that morning before 12 hours and lady said there's no van available.  She could tell I was going to get upset and said wait and looked at her computer and found a van I could rent.  Not sure what that was about since the reservation was guaranteed the next morning.  I am only giving 2 star since the van was nice. They would reimburse me for the first night. Save yourself a few dollars and rent somewhere with 24 operating hours at the front desk.",2,US,"November 15, 2023"

"Total scam!  We reserved a SUV and purchased the pre-pay rate package.  We paid $371 for the week rental and $150 deposit, however, when we got to the rental place, they told us they had to charge us $188 for the loss damage waiver, which is an ""add on"" on their website and does not state it's required ANYWHERE on their website. Our reservation clearly states TOTAL COST $371, however, they ended up charging us $613!!",1,US,"December 09, 2023"

overall experience was great. However when picking up the vehicle I noticed the gas tank was on half not full but the contract reflected full so I took a picture for proof just in case. Thankfully I took the picture because upon my return I had to show the picture as proof with a time stamp on the picture…if not for my quick thinking they would have charged me for half a tank of gas that I in fact did not use absolutely not good business practice….,4,US,"December 08, 2023"

I wrote to the Operations Manager there several times & he never responded. what a gutless person! stay away from Fox! they don't care about you! worst car rental place ever!!",1,US,"December 11, 2023"

"Firstly, registration and vehicle pick up was at the airport and was a very reasonable walk from the arrival gate. Secondly, the pick up process was fast and relativley easy; it also helped that there was no line, so service was prompt. Thirdly, receiving the car was also easy although there was a slight glitch with getting me a car. Fourth, returning the was fast and without any issues. However, Fox has a written policy that penalizes you for returing the car earlier than the time you agreed to, and it is a hefty amount. So, I did not want to test it and waited 20 minutes to return the car at exactly 4pm as agreed; however, the worker who processed the return was puzzled and looked somewhat incredulous when I explained it all to him.",4,N/A,"December 09, 2023"

Everything exceeded my expectations! The staff at the counter was so nice and friendly, she pointed out to me all the important items to notice, and didn't try to sell me any unecessary purchases at all. She even upgraded my car!

"Quality Company - had a reservation with another company (NuCar) who tried charging us extras for being ""International renters"" from Canada, and forcing us to take their insurance at an additional cost of $50/day. Our credit card already covers insurance and stipulates we must decline rental agency's insurance, but NuCar refused to give us a car unless we paid it.  Fox was able to get us in a car quickly and didn't try to charge anything extra. The woman checking us out was quick and helpful - 10/10 experience with the check out + return process.",5,US,"November 26, 2023"

Great location.  Everyone was so friendly and attentive.,5,US,"December 01, 2023"
"Fox is the only rental car that I will use from now on. You can always count on the quality of vehicles. There's nothing ever weird that happens like in some cases when you're trying to rent a car with other companies. They are very professional and communicate well. The cars are always good quality and clean. And if they don't have your vehicle, they don't make you wait, they just upgrade you automatically when you enter the parking lot to pick up your vehicle. They always have something available so you're never waiting for anything. And there's never a problem. Whether you're renting it off site or at the airport....it just seems to flow so easy. Fox will always be my go to when renting a car..",5,US,"November 25, 2023"

"The only issue I had was the person who assisted me would receiving my vehicle, after we soke a bit he convinced me that the type of area I was gonna be driving in would need to upgrade.That would be safe for me. The vehicle was not safe. The tires were worn and on pockets of water it would slide or skid.  So I had to reduce my travel time and be cautious.  It also pulled to the right, which means there was a balancing issue with that vehicle.  I paid extra for an upgrade when I feel that this vehicle was a downgrade.  The only plus was it didn't waste a lot of gas.  But I would prefer a safer Vehicle with good tires and good tread.  I rented this vehicle for a week. If I was in the area I would have brought it back for replacement.",3,CA,"November 17, 2023"

"We rented a van in Phoenix Arizona at the airport. We returned the rental, ON TIME, full of gas to the car rental return area. 5 days after we returned the car, we got a call from Fox asking where the car was? Told them we returned it ON TIME to the airport lot. It's 2 weeks later and they say they still can't find the car. They told me they don't have GPS trackers in the cars, for ""privacy reasons"". This is completely ridiculous and we will NEVER again rent from Fox and will be suing them if they try to stick us with additional charges.",1,US,"November 17, 2023"

Overall it was very good. We got the vehicle we wanted (Charger). They need to provide more front desk help at the LAX location. Move that line along.And be a little more careful cleaning the inside of the vehicle. I don't care about crumbs or anything that dusts off but when its smear marks on controls and a seat now you have us creeped out.,5,PE,"November 19, 2023"

"Me and my wife thought would have a lousy off-airport car rental experience, but turned out surprisingly easy, quick and comfortable. The shuttle bus took us from Salt Lake International Airport to the Fox car rental center for only about seven minutes. When we got there, there was no waiting line. I showed my reservation confirmation to the front lady. She was friendly, polite, and very easy to talk with. The whole interaction was completed very quickly. I remembered she did mention about additional options for us about the rental car reservation, but there was no overly aggressive and forceful selling of car upgrades, insurance coverages, and gas savings. I got the car exactly as what I reserved for among many other good cars, nice and clean, on the parking lot. Then we drove 3.5 hours to Moab. For the next six days we visited Arches & Canyonlands National Parks. we drove to many trailheads and did a lot of our long planned hiking. The Toyota Camry we rented full filled our needs. It’s powerful, comfortable, and gas saving. we enjoyed every bit of this car. At the end of our seven day vacation, we drove back to the rental station to drop off the car, and that process was swift. we were treated respectfully and friendly by everyone in the Fox car rental center. I’ve had a handful of car rental experiences before. This one stands out above all else. I would be definitely happy to recommended Fox car rental to others. Oh, almost forgot to mention, my wife is still happy about the hot water she got from that self serve drinking machine in the lobby which is quiet, spacious, and comfortable. The restroom is super clean and well maintained.",5,CA,"November 11, 2023"

"I have never heard of Fox Rentals before. I felt I got a nice car rental for the money. Fair prices. Picking up and returning the car was not difficult. Probably my only complaint would be that their logo signs ""Fox"", were so much smaller than the other car rentals at the airport. So you couldn't really see it. I had to ask where it was located and it was just down the aisle from where I was standing. So the logo needs to be bigger as the others. Would I rent from Fox again? Most definitely I would!",5,US,"November 18, 2023"
"Clean car at a highly competitive price. Staff were mostly a delight to interact with. The company does need to have more shuttle bus between airports, wait time is too long.",4,US,"October 21, 2023"
"The staff did not pressure us from buying extra liability insurance.  Our credit card provides us that service.  I like that.  They respect our wishes.  Also, Fox reimburses the cost of gas left in the tank if you opt for pre-paid gas.  We like that as well.",5,US,"October 28, 2023"

"The guy on the counter was very helpful and did what he had to do to get us our vehicle. just don't understand why someone working there does not have access to switch the first name on a reservation.

"Line up at pickup was not long but we had to wait for a printer problem. The staff at the counter told me to take a 2nd elevator, which leads to the 2nd floor down but Fox car pick up is at the bottom floor. It would be nice if he could just told me bottom floor. Car was ok, driver rare tire was low on pressure a day after I picked it up. Interior was clean but driver window have stain left over.",3,LC,"November 06, 2023"

"It was very convenient. My brother forgot the credit card he reserved the rental on and they do not take debit card.  The gentleman at the counter was nice enough to match the price so I could place the rental on my credit card.  The shuttle rides back and forth to and from the rental location is very nice too have.  The car was perfect for us though the ""low air"" for the tire/s  light turned on, it worked fine but I let the car folks know about it when I returned the vehicle.",5,US,"November 04, 2023"

The whole experience of picking up the vehicle and driving it without any problems and smooth drop off. The vehicle was very clean and was a comfortable ride.,5,US,"November 14, 2023"
"Cheapest rate. You get what you pay for..or nothing at all. The counter was off-site from the airport. The shuttle driver drove like a maniac! After being abruptly dropped off to the off-site location and after waiting in line, the front counter proceeded to tell me that they did not have the vehicle I reserved and did not give me any options. So, I had to take the motion sickness shuttle back to the airport and rent a car from Budget for about the same price. The Budget experience was great! I do not recommend FOX Rent a car at all!",1,US,"November 16, 2023"
Great customer service! Awesome vehicle!  Great value!,5,US,"October 30, 2023"

"Brenda the desk agent at SFO was extremely customer friendly and helpful.  I have rented from Fox ovrrr the last 3 years and have always found the  agents are consistently customer oriented and friendly.  Brenda was particularly helpful as there was some issues when we rented the car. The rental was under my wife’s name and the reservation was reserved with my credit card. When I traveled, my wife was not traveling with me and was told I could not rent the car since the reservation was under my wife’s name. after traveling for 18 hours from Europe, my heart sank when I was told I can’t rent the car. however, Brenda took the extra effort to make sure I could rent a car and was able to rebook the reservation under my name. It took a little extra time but she wanted to make sure I could get the car. I travel often between Europe and California about 6 times a year, and and of all the other car rental agencies I have rented from, Fox ranks at the top. Your agents have always have demonstrated that customers come first.",5,US,"November 08, 2023"
This was the best car rental experience I have ever had from start to finish!!!,5,US,"November 08, 2023"
"Would not recommend this company. When we got to the counter, they asked us if we wanted to add any other drivers, we said as long as it isn't extra, sure as we had 4 people in our party. Only 1 of us ended up driving. Turns out they charged us 12.99 per day extra per driver. When we called to question this charge, they basically told us "" tough luck"" .  Also asked us if we wanted a toll transponder enabled, we didn't expect to go through any tolls but as long as it didn't cost any extra, sure. Sure enough, they charged us for that also, and we never even used it. It would have been cheaper to just pay tolls. Would never use this company and would discourage anyone not to use this company. Am not one to write reviews, but this was to much not to say something.",1,US,"November 04, 2023"
"The rental car counter staff is friendly and provide details information and recommendation. However, the instruction paper to guide people to go from the rental car counter office to the location where the car is parked is very very confusing. Inside the garage, I had to ask more than 2 people to help to find the floor and the spot where the car is parked.",4,US,"November 12, 2023"
Car pick up experience was not that good the person on desk were so slow and took a long time Otherwise car was too good and clean,4,US,"November 13, 2023"
Deonica made our experience great! She was the best car rental employee we've ever experience in over 30yrs renting cars and 100% changed the way we felt renting from FOX.,5,US,"November 08, 2023"
The staff was helpful and friendly. That was the best deal in town.,5,US,"November 12, 2023"
"We saved around $100 over all the other rental agencies and we got a full sized car. However you have to be willing to walk a bit to get to the shuttle pick-up spot when arriving. . Maybe an extra 5 minutes. Drop off for departures is right at the terminal.  When picking up the car, the agent added my wife as a driver at no additional charge. The shuttle drivers, both to and from the airport, were helpful and friendly. Dropping off the car was smooth and quick, even at 5:15AM.",5,US,"November 13, 2023"
Everything went smoothly was not given any hidden charges car was there an available and transportation to and from the airport which timely.,5,US,"November 11, 2023"
"The lady at the counter in Fort Lauderdale was a delightful individual. She was also a very good salesperson. A charge that was mistakenly added was removed when requested in Tampa as well. The vehicle was great. We took very good care of it, and Fox took good care of us.",5,US,"November 13, 2023"
Fox was great to work with. Will use them again.,5,US,"November 14, 2023"
"Easily accessible rentals at Burbank Airport. Very convenient to return after hours. The car we rented exceeded expectations as to features and newness. The price couldn’t be beat. Although we didn’t fly into Burbank, it was the best option for our local family trip.",5,US,"November 12, 2023"
Service to the airport and back was quick and easy.  If you are given a choice on cars don't get a Kia Soul.,4,US,"November 07, 2023"
"Prices, and the shuttle service always bring me back. Plus the shuttle drivers are always so friendly and happy to help!",5,US,"November 07, 2023"
So much easier and organized than our last two east coast rentals with other companies. Fox was excellent all around and started out NFL weekend off perfectly!,5,US,"November 10, 2023"
"Good price , nice suv!!!!  Easy dealing with Fox!",5,US,"November 08, 2023"
The price was great and car was wonderful. The representative at the Tampa airport was really helpful and friendly. All around a 5 star experience,5,N/A,"November 06, 2023"

"All of the Fox employees I encountered were courteous, respectful and professional. Their honest efforts were greatly appreciated.",5,US,"November 11, 2023"
The worst rental company for cars. be aware that this company charges you a lot extra after returning car. A lot of hidden fees after returning. This has happen to me in Miami airport car returns,1,US,"October 17, 2023"

"Always a consistent positive experience when traveling to LAX.  Efficient, frequent shuttle to or from off-site facility.  Pleasant staff all around.  Fair pricing makes it a no-brainer.",5,US,"November 11, 2023"
They gave me an upgrade because they did not have any of the mid-sized I had requested.  I expressed some concern because I am short and it can be difficult to see over dashboards of many cars.  The agent made sure to get me a car that raised the seat high.  It was super comfortable and I really appreciated the consideration.,5,KY,"November 01, 2023"

"I was offered a free upgrade to the model I was supposed to get due to availability at the moment. The staff was friendly and jovial. One thing comes to mind … at the Car Return garage, the metal spikes made me stop because I thought it would puncture the tires. Your return staff had to wave me through. Maybe a simple sign that it is OK to proceed in that direction over the spikes.",5,N/A,"October 29, 2023"
Know the insurance policies ahead of time.  This was my first time renting.  Out of fear they piled on insurance 3 layers thick.  Example I have triple A.. they added on roadside .. called it basic.  Ended up being $327 over what I prepaid ahead of time.  Si I thought I had car prepaid…. Counter pushed sales of extras.So if you are new to renting.. beware.,3,US,"November 05, 2023"
"A BAIT AND SWITCH price increase scam. You are so transparent it's ridiculous. I reserve a car and then when I arrive ""surprisingly"" it is not available, but we have the next higher for another 15 dollars....that's a fraud.  Only after 3 pushbacks did you agree to give me the car at no price increase. THAT is a SCAM. I will NOT recommend ANYONE rent from Fox.",1,US,"November 05, 2023"
Customer service is excellent and pricing is good.,5,US,"November 07, 2023"
They were the most friendly and service minded staff I've ever met at a car rental place.,5,US,"November 08, 2023"
Very personal experience. We went to the booth in the parking lot and were met by a wonderfully helpful agent who took all of ten mins to get us on our way.,5,US,"November 02, 2023"
"This was my first experience with Fox.  Check in was a little slower then other well known rental companies.  It would have been nice to have 2-3 agents checking people in.  Other then that the checkin experience was fine.  Purchased on Priceline and received a Great Value! The vehicle was new, very clean, and better then expected gas mileage.  We drove over 1600 miles in a week and had no problems.  Return checkin  was seamless.  Overall experience was great.",5,US,"October 30, 2023"
"I often rent from FOX when in Las Vegas.  Great value and the folks that attend you in every area are very customer oriented and friendly They let you know all the charges and choices.  Never a surprise bill.  You have to take a shuttle from the main airport to the rental car site then another shuttle to the rental site, but it is always an easy trip, the ride is very short and not crowded like the one that gets you to the main airport rental site.  I asked to extend my car for one day and it was a very smooth fix. Thank you Fox",5,US,"November 01, 2023"
Got a competitive price but was up charged for different things. By the time I was done Enterprise would have been far better. I would never use Fox again.,1,CA,"November 04, 2023"
"Staff was friendly and efficient. Prices were cheaper than anywhere else. The only fault was the vehicle was not clean, but I just wiped it down myself. Cheryl",5,US,"November 03, 2023"

"Fast and friendly service. No hidden fees. And no high pressure up-sell. ""Luxury"" car selection exceeded my expectations.",5,US,"November 09, 2023"
"Shuttle pickup was timely and there was only a brief wait once we arrived at the counter. The car was perfectly clean and drove well. It did, however, need new wiper blades. Very hard to see clearly at night in a light San Francisco rain. I told the return clerk, so hopefully that is addressed for safety.",4,CA,"November 05, 2023"
"Have rented from Fox Rent a Car several times at Fort Lauderdale airport.  Never had any problems, and their prices have usually been the lowest.  I usually prepay to get the best rates.",5,US,"November 11, 2023"
Car with up todate features.  Wireless that connected easily.  Good breaks and steering.  Clean and no smokeGreat price.  Friendly staff that stayed until planes arrived,5,US,"November 01, 2023"
Best to book on expedia if you want to save some cash. Due to insurance is a little more costly.,4,US,"November 07, 2023"
"The shuttle drivers were polite, the staff was helpful and quick. After a bad experience with the first rental company, the speed of getting in the door and out with the key was great.only problem was returning the vehicle. GPS couldn’t figure out how to get us to the drop off location, brought us to a business park across the street, then the exit only. TOO MANY FLORIDA BARRIERS.",4,US,"November 02, 2023"
"The pick-up and return @Fox was quick & efficient. The Toyota 4 Runner was more spacious than the Hyundai Santa Fe we reserved, but it was a gas guzzler at about 18 miles a gallon.",5,US,"November 10, 2023"
"Everything worked the way it was supposed to. Don’t believe all the negative reviews. It was quick, efficient and a pleasant experience. I went when it wasn’t busy and the line does move a bit slow so I may have felt differently had I gone when they were busy.",5,US,"November 06, 2023"
"Less than 5min wait for airport shuttle. Little wait at counter, Angel T and entire staff were pleasant and friendly. Car was clean. Overall great experience. I would definitely use Fox RSW again!",5,N/A,"November 05, 2023"
The best was about the staff on duty and the shuttle  drivers were absolutely wonderful !!,5,US,"November 08, 2023"

Awesome Experience!!!!!,5,US,"November 07, 2023"
Customer service is great.Overall experience with Fox was very good. However I think there shuttle service should run as frequently as the other car rental companies.,4,US,"October 24, 2023"
"The car was great and the rental rates were good, but the counter rep used every truck in the book to upsell me.  I thought  I was dealing with a used vacuum cleaner salesman. It was way over the top, pushy and poor training on the part of the Fox DIA team.",4,GB,"October 31, 2023"
"We booked a car from Fox through a third party website, and got, what we thought was a great deal. We were quoted £427 for 14 days rental.  It ended up costing us almost £1400. When we arrived at the desk, we were told that we had to buy their insurance, and toll charges, otherwise it would cost us a lot more if we didn't.  We were tired from the long flight, and worried that we wouldn't have transport for our holiday, so we had to agree to that.  He scrolled through his tablet to the bottom and asked us to sign, which we did, and then asked for a $1300 deposit.  We were shocked at the amount, but thought we would get most of it back at the end. He did not give us a copy of the signed agreement, so we couldn't look at what they had charged us. It wasn't until we got home and rang them to send us a copy, that we saw that there were, in total, 12 charges on there that we were not expecting.  They had added optional extras, that we had NOT been asked if we wanted, so really were not optional at all, they just added them anyway.  All those things, of course increased the tax. So in the end we did not get any deposit back, and on top of what we had already paid when we booked it, cost us £1400, almost as much as our holiday. We were absolutely gutted, that totally ruined our time there, we have never had problems like that before when we have booked rentals through other companies.  Fox car rentals need to be more transparent about their charges, and make sure the customer is absolutely clear about what they are signing for.  And maybe re-train their staff, instead of letting them get away with the underhand selling that we experienced.  Feeling ripped off.",1,US,"September 12, 2023"
Rented a car through Expedia and turned out to be Fox Rentals. We were extremely happy with the nice Mercedes car and easy pickup and return. I will rent from Fox again when I am in the area!,5,BS,"November 04, 2023"

This is the second time I’ve rented with Fox Rent a Car this year (Ontario and LAX airport). Both times everything has gone very smoothly. My LAX experience was better though and I wanted to recognize Omar who surveyed our needs thoroughly and was very friendly.,5,US,"November 04, 2023"
"I booked Toyota 4 Runner or equivalent via third party Priceline for my trip to Oakland CaliforniaOn Nov 4th 2023. Upon my arrival at the Oakland airport, I was told that they don’t have any SUV available. So either I get a mini van or a Toyota Corolla. I’m not a mini Van person and for two ppl with no luggage it was not worth it. So I ended up getting a downgrade of Toyota Corolla. Definitely not happy about the overall experience. Staff was friendly at the desk and return of the car was a breeze. No issue there.",3,US,"November 04, 2023"
Friendly and smiling agents. The best attitudes I have experienced in a long time.,5,US,"November 06, 2023"
"Wait was long considering the facility's AC was not cooling effectively.  Representative was extremely nice.  Car's interior had not been cleaned. Overall, considering price, I would definitely recommend/rent again.",4,CA,"November 05, 2023"
Prices were good (much cheaper than Avis and other big name brands). The car we got was new. The only difficulty we had was returning the car to LAX. It was night and there are no large lit signs  of the return location.,5,US,"November 03, 2023"
"These guys are running some kind of scam here. I went to their Las Vegas location and rented a car for 4 days. We drove the car for a total of 150 miles for the duration of our stay and returned it with a full tank of gas. When we checked the car back in, the guy didn't check anything and just said ""you're good"". That was a bit shady to us, so we took a picture of the fuel tank, anticipating a false claim about something. Sure enough....they claimed we returned the vehicle with 1/8 tank of gas. At $8.99/gallon, we were charged $180 to fill up the car, after the fact. When we called to correct the error, the attitude was PROVE IT. Luckily, WE CAN. And rather than deal with this HACK JOB of a car rental company we will be filing with any and every agency we can to make them aware of the scheme Fox Rent-a-Car is running on honest customers. If you have this same experience REPORT THEM TO THE FTC!!! SHAME ON YOU FOX. Never again! DO NOT RENT A CAR FROM THIS PLACE.",1,CA,"November 06, 2023"

The process was completed quickly and expertly,5,US,"November 07, 2023"
"Great experience with Fox at San Francisco airport. Quick pick up at airport, knowledgeable staff at desk who did not pressure us. I booked the car ahead of time and we usually get full replacement insurance. I registered on the Fox website with my name, but my husband was going to be primary driver. I was unable to book car under his name but they fixed that when we got there. I could also be a driver as a spouse at no extra charge! The vehicle got good gas mileage so we filled off site at slightly lower cost. We were not pressured to have Fox fill with gas. It is hard to bring a car back close to empty. Good experience!",5,N/A,"November 05, 2023"
"I was hesitant to try Fox but I'm so glad I did, I go to Dallas about four times a year. This is my first time trying him, everyone was so nice. The line was non-existent so fast, the car was awesome. The inspection upon leaving was great. So there would be no doubt of damage, and I really enjoyed the convenience of returning the car. Fox is the first centered drop off in the south drop off. A plus. Plus I will read from them again",5,US,"November 10, 2023"

All aspects were great and the low price for the same service elsewhere was so worth it.,5,US,"November 05, 2023"
Fox has bailed me out of a tough situation more than once and always provides an easy and helpful experience. I seek them out now as my first choice.,5,US,"October 29, 2023"
"The Fox location is not located at the airport, you have to take a shuttle bus, which runs all the time. At the rental location the service was quick and efficient, and they don’t push you to accept their optional coverages. Returning the car was quick, and you get your final bill by email.",5,US,"November 04, 2023"

"The is no separate line if you already made reservations so the wait time is long.

"La peor experiencia al rentar un vehicuko, mi esposa y yo alquilamos el vehiculo en Orlando, FL. Y luego de entregar el vehiculo nos cobraron un cargo extra del cual no se nos informó, lo peor es que lo hicieron despues que regrese a mi pais de residencia. No recomiendo esta empresa y no nos quieren devolver el dinero estafado. Reserve por expedia 194 dolares y al final termine pagando 384 dolares. Son unos ladrones.The worst experience when renting a vehicle, my wife and I rented the vehicle in Orlando, FL. And after delivering the vehicle they charged us an extra charge of which we were not informed, the worst thing is that they did it after I returned to my country of residence.

They are thiefs.",1,US,"November 06, 2023"

"Everything about the rental was positive, from the fast, efficient, courteous service at check-in, to the pickup of the car which was upgraded, to the efficient, courteous return of the car.

I do think that it would be helpful if there was a brief explanatory information sheet on each car regarding the various labeling of the electronic features.",5,US,"October 29, 2023"

Great rates and car selection! Will be renting with again on my next trip!,5,US,"October 30, 2023"
"Can’t beat fox rates generally but the lower rate comes at a time cost. Lack of rental car customer service staff required long wait times in Miami. This is also because many foreign nationals rent in Miami and they generally have no experience renting a car from fox so they take much longer to decide coverages etc etc. Maybe a kiosk when customers can check in with a few simple questions as to whether they need toll passes, extra insurance coverage, vehicle adds(car seats etc). If they check in with few issues, send them to express checkout.",4,US,"November 02, 2023"
"I was very pleased with my most recent experience with Fox rental at the Oakland Airport location in California. I am a frequent renter and appreciate their good rates and choice of vehicles. The pickup process is very efficient and simple, while the drop off is even easier. The ladies assisting with the checking out and receiving of the vehicles in the lot are very courteous. I hope they keep up the good service and keep low the rental rates.",5,US,"October 31, 2023"

At the counter, Jameelaah was funny and helpful, providing excellent customer service as well as recommendations for things to do and places to eat. Returning the car was as simple as parking at the return lot with a quick inspection and that was it! Our return shuttle driver also helped with our bags, shared funny stories on the way back to the airport and then gave simple instructions to get to our airline counter from the drop-off point. 10/10 from start to finish!",5,N/A,"October 24, 2023"
Service personnel were great. Vehicle had minor mechanical problems.,4,PR,"October 28, 2023"
The care and price were great and the car was waiting for me.  I didn't rate it a 5 because it took a while to check in and the gas was just under the full line.  But it was still a very good value for the money and I will look to rent from them again.,4,US,"November 01, 2023"

The vehicle was dated and had a smell.  I did not like how I was lied to about tolls.  I had to pay an extra $90.00 because I was told that the toll booths did not accept payment.  That was a complete lie.   I will never rent from Fox again.,3,US,"October 20, 2023"

Pleasantly surprised as a first time Fox customer,5,US,"October 31, 2023"
"The price was great- no added fees. Pickup and drop off was easy in the office. The shuttle bus took forever to arrive at the airport when we first landed in Orlando. We called twice and waited 45 minutes. The vehicle ran well and was clean, but there was no wiper fluid, the front passenger turn signal needed a bulb and the check engine light would sporadically go on.",4,US,"October 20, 2023"

Fox rental is easily half the price of many other car rental companies. There are a nice assortment of cars to choose from so you'll get what you want. The best aspect is the staff. Everyone is very friendly and courteous and goes out of their way to make sure you're happy. Why rent from anywhere else?,5,US,"October 26, 2023"
Smooth and easy experience and friendly staff at the Fox location in Atlanta airport rental car center. I highly recommend this rental agency!,5,US,"October 27, 2023"

I explained but employee didnt believe me until I showed him the picture i took of the dash.The employee that gave me the car never notated the fuel level.Take pictures,  it saved me from being charged .CYA!!",4,DK,"October 23, 2023"
"Most terrible experience ever. They fail on all levels, and we decided to cancel. STAY AWAY from the company. Bad service, rude, no flexibility, no smiles, very slow, must sign many items that user dont understand - extremely fishy. I normally love the high service in America, being fm Europe, but this one was CRAP!!!",1,US,"October 31, 2023"

Excellent service provided at the counter.,5,US,"October 26, 2023"
Customer service was great but it should not take two shuttles to get to the rental place or back to the airport.,4,CA,"October 29, 2023"
"Friendly fast service at the counter, price was pretty close to what I was expecting. Vehicle condition was a little bit low, had damage and wasn’t very clean inside. Checking it out was a bit of a pain, because all previous damage wasn’t previously recorded. Tank was only half full, but that was corrected on the return, overall I was happy.",4,US,"October 22, 2023"
It is always a pleasure to rent from Fox. I always rent from them when they are available at the area which I travel.,5,US,"October 22, 2023"

"Not sure why the bad reviews. We had a great experience from pick up to drop off. Shuttle pulled up as we were exiting the airport. Shuttle ride was clean and comfortable. Took no time to complete the required paperwork and keys handed to me.  Was offered additional fees such as tolls, insurance, etc but politely declined and never felt pushed to purchase. Be sure to have your declaration page from your auto insurance, which we did. Was in the car and out of the lot all within 15 minutes. Car was clean, full tank of gas and all in all, very nice ride.  Drop off process was just as smooth as pick up. Will definitely rent from Fox again.",5,US,"October 20, 2023"
Ability to upgrade my vehicle to better model than I initially requested. It made my journey and movements very enjoyable.,5,SK,"October 24, 2023"
"With the shuttle between the rental lot and the airport, renting at Sea-Tac is easy.

The process was smooth and I was very happy with the rental.",5,US,"October 23, 2023"

"Shuttles for this carrier leave the Orlando Airport about every 5-10 mins (our original rental company took 40 mins to get us and then another 30 to get us through their line, only to discover they had just canceled our reservation bc we were ""late"", then tried to swap us into another rental for an additional $600 since they werent going to refund our original prepaid price).  Fox found us a car last min, for almost what our original reservation was and had us on the road within 30 mins from arriving to their shop. Drop off was even easier and we were back at the airport within 30-45 mins total. Car was in excellent shape and wonderful to drive.",5,PR,"October 28, 2023"
"Everything was awesome, I rented the car , after a while with only one telephone call I extended the period of the rental. All in all renting the car from Fox Rent a Car was a great experience.",5,US,"September 28, 2023"

Great vehicle at a great price. We waited almost 30 minutes for the shuttle and another 30 minutes in line at the rental counter. But we got a vehicle upgrade so it’s ok.,4,N/A,"October 22, 2023"

"Absolutely avoid, avoid, avoid. Insurance scam-hidden charges.I arrived at the LAX to be served by a staff member who thought it was ok to charge me for insurance even though Orbitz had already charged me for it. I also had an additional all risks insurance policy which I buy annually-again this wasn’t acceptable. Basically it’s a hidden insurance scam between Fox and Orbitz. I ended up $250 out of pocket.On the plus side the SUV I hired was in good condition but I only had satnav by checking about 10 SUV in the car park as some didn’t have the sat nav download. Return process and courtesy bus back to LAX was fine.Why use travel apps like Orbitz and unknown car hire companies when you have reliable companies like Hertz and Dollar.",1,US,"October 22, 2023"
That for the service and rental of car.,5,US,"October 22, 2023"
"Mr. Clyde was knowledgeable set me up for success he was true and honest, but gentle with his words. I appreciated this kind of service at such a stressful time. He is tall guy curly hair African American brother.Thank youSankofa PCS,LLC🌱",5,US,"October 07, 2023"

Outstanding service from the shuttle bus to behind the counter to the return people. Traveled to Orlando during MEA weekend. Never rented from FOX. Off site rental is the ticket vs. on the grounds of the airport. Saved $200. Will do it again!!,5,CA,"October 19, 2023"

"Overall good experience. Many people were leaving the cars on the road, but the staffs were very calm and helpful. The Gas price info was deceptive to buy full gas tank. Label says $ 6.99 outside and Fox charges $5.99. Outside it was $5.19. Deceptive business practice. Otherwise nice ecperience",5,US,"October 22, 2023"
"The staff was incredibly accommodating. There was a delay because of other clients not returning vehicles in a timely manner, and I feel I was fairly compensated for my trouble. I support this team and management.",5,US,"October 18, 2023"
Loved the shuttle guy and the young lady at the pickup office,5,US,"October 20, 2023"
Efficient. Great service.,5,US,"October 14, 2023"

Was able to get a car earlier than planned.,5,US,"October 24, 2023"
"Edit: I fist believed I’d been grossly overcharged- (showed on my CC as a lot more than expected) but have since had the charge modified to what I expected it to be. So overall this has changed my rating from 1 to 5 for FOX. However, I’d book directly in future - NOT through Priceline.Car was fine. It was upgraded (according to the person who helped me) and was clean.",5,US,"October 26, 2023"
"Finding the shuttle at the airport was simple and friendly drivers. Amazing agents at the desk, the ease of renting a vehicle, my rental was clean, the ease of returning a vehicle and the fact that everybody spoke English. Not to mention that there were no hidden fees on my bill, and I didn't feel like I was trying to get scammed. Can't wait to do business with Fox again!",5,US,"October 18, 2023"
The company provided a nice selection of vehicles to choose from. The pickup as well as drop off procedures are smooth and if timed right the shuttle will arrive before you know it.

"everything was neatly arranged, we also delivered neatly and neat company",5,US,"October 22, 2023"
"Best price by far so well worth it. Just be aware that it was an off airport site that required a second shuttle and once there the line to get the car moved slowly, so expect to spend a fair amount of time getting the rental squared away. also there was a lot of up selling ( get this insurance or that insurance) which i mostly declined.  but overall the price was great, the car was fine and the return went smoothly and quickly so well worth it and i would use Fox again.",4,US,"October 20, 2023"
"Pickup and return were uncomplicated and convenient. The staff at the desk and the parking lot was helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. The van was in excellent condition, had all the bells and whistles and was easy to drive. Overall it was a great experience",5,US,"October 23, 2023"

Everything was great with the exception of picking the car up.  I waited in line for an hour as there was only one person working the counter.,5,US,"October 17, 2023"
I had questions specifically about insurance coverage before I even rented the vehicle.

"Love the drop off process but I wish the pick up process was just as easy.  I waited in line for over half hour and I had prepaid for my vehicle.  I wish I could have just gone up to the floor and once my identity was verified, I would have been handed a set of keys but, no. I waited in line and then I had to go through the whole process where I get asked the 15 questions by the clerk.",3,US,"October 11, 2023"

Staff was extremely helpful. Grateful that they had availability as the other company that we per-booked did not have a car for us.,5,US,"October 20, 2023"
"Agents are helpful and friendly, shuttle service is great!  Your rental car will probably be dirty and if that bugs you, then skip.  Be sure to fill up your gas tank across the street from the drop off or they will charge you $$$ to fill up a gallon of gas you used to drive there.",3,CA,"October 23, 2023"

"Great customer service, value for price, checkout process, and car selection",5,EC,"October 17, 2023"
"Positives: Nice rep at the counter while picking up the car; easy drop-off and quick shuttle service to the airport. The car itself was no frills with a bit of a glitchy cruise control, but it served its purpose. Not so positive: Being charged $110.00 upon return for an extra driver and insurance which I hadn't requested nor used. It took several hours over 2 days with many phone calls to my bank, Fox itself, and a 3rd party through which I had reserved the car. I prevailed in the end, but it was irritating and makes me hesitant to use them again. Maybe...",3,US,"October 20, 2023"
"All the personnel were really nice, from the counter person to getting the car. The guy that took me to my car was about to get off work but he could see the other guy was busy so he helped me and I didn't have to wait.",5,US,"October 17, 2023"

"I was recommended to use Fox. I was pleasantly surprised at the quick and efficient time it took to receive my car. The Fox rep was very nice and even offered an upgrade, but I declined. On my return, the process was also quick and efficient. I received my email receipt even before I got to the airport. My only problem was that Fox could not drop us off at the departure doors, but that was not the fault of Fox. It was a new rule with LAX. I will be looking to rent from Fox in the future.",5,US,"October 04, 2023"
"The 2023 Toyota RAV4 performed flawlessly and got terrific gas mileage, 38.3 mpg, and it was not even a Hybrid.",4,US,"October 22, 2023"

"A economy rental company, prices are good however having rented from them several times and 50% of vehicles I had to exchange due to mechanical issues. The team at airport was gracious and the roadside team was also helpful, it is when I dealt with ""offshore"" support that there was a disconnect.",3,US,"October 16, 2023"

Easy to get. Easy drop off.,5,US,"October 14, 2023"
"2 shuttles to get to Fox's location, we returned our rental early so we didn't have to deal with the shuttles before flying home! Our seat belt had broken glass in it so it wouldn't fasten & the alarm went off until we got to our hotel! We had to dig the small glass fragments out in order to it to fasten properly! We'll gladly use fox again in the future but not in Las Vegas",4,US,"October 12, 2023"
"The experience would have gotten 5 stars except they lied about local gas prices.  They made it sound like a bargain to pre-pay the gas, meanwhile actual gas prices were MUCH lower than they told me.  Otherwise, the rental was great.",4,US,"October 09, 2023"

"I had previously rented from Dollar in Los Angeles LAX and compared to the terrible experience I had with Dollar, I highly recommend Fox.  Dollar left me without any vehicle for over two hours while Fox, in Orlando, who also had  a lack of the mid size suv I requested, immediately provided me with a full sized suv….no waiting! Well done Fox!",5,US,"October 15, 2023"
"I was in and out in 10 minutes getting my rental. My car was nice, new and clean. Drop off was really easy. The shuttle was super quick both at pick up and drop off. I will be using them again. Thank you FOX. Also, their employees at the rental office are very nice.",5,US,"October 17, 2023"

"1st time user of your company. Visiting my daughter for her birthday and Miguel upgraded our car and no extra charge to my daughters favorite SUV, she was so excited when we showed up in that.  Miguel was very professional, courteous and friendly. Very good customer service skills.  Downside would be we had to inspect the vehicle with very little light and it was wet from being washed, so we missed a lot of minor damage we didn't mark on the paper card and was worried we would get changed.  Very happy you did not charge us for those items.  Now the older ""exit security guard"" male that greeted you as you exited the lot after picking up the car was very rude, NO customer service skills at all.  Had we not had such good customer service with Miguel, we would have probably planned on not using your company again because of that ""exit security guard"" guy. At an exit gate, in the dark, in a town we are not familiar with, knowing we had an hour drive to our daughters house and getting his attitude was not the way to start our trip in Denver.  Thank you Miguel for saving the bad start.",4,US,"October 11, 2023"
one of the easiest check in and check out rentals I have ever done.  Very convenient and the best thing is it was about half the price of the big boy car rentals. I will always look for a Fox car rental first before any other company. PERIOD..,5,US,"October 13, 2023"

"Fox car rental makes it very easy to rent cars. What I have liked best about them is when I’ve needed help which has only been a few times, they listened and truly helped me out.

"Car, price and service were great! However, it is quite far off site from the airport and requires 2 shuttles. I recommend just taking an Uber there and back so you don't have to stand in line for the shuttles and waste time.",4,US,"October 07, 2023"

"Helpful, friendly service. The only issue I had with Fox is that they left the pick-up area before 12:00am, leaving me stranded and having to rent another vehicle to get to my destination. Our SW flight was delayed half an hour. We arrived at 11:37pm, and having no bags we were at the pick-up area at 11:50. The Fox shuttle had just left, just missed it. And that is on me! Had I called ahead, I am sure Fox would have waited the extra few minutes to fetch my wife and me. Can’t over communicate too much. Once I did get to Fox the next morning, everything worked out splendidly.",5,US,"October 09, 2023"
"I'm very tall and my passengers are also, the staff provided me with an upgrade to suit my height! With no problem!!!",5,US,"October 13, 2023"

"We really appreciated your staff member Charnika at the Oakland Airport. Prior to serving us she had a difficult client who seemed to require extra service and didn't quite have everything they needed to secure their rental. We waited behind them at least 15 minutes while they went through the process. Charnika remained calm, pleasant and professional with that group, then had a smile to greet us when we approached. Beyond that I am hard of hearing and while I could not hear everything, she said, she was apologetic, patient, extremely understanding and accommodating.  She went above and beyond to ensure we understood and had everything we needed. It can often be challenging to receive service with a genuine smile and positive temperament but Kudos to Fox for employing and hopefully elevating such a pleasant, positive, and professional agent, Chanika, she is definitely an asset. Please make sure she is aware of our appreciation.",5,US,"October 08, 2023"

"Due to a change in flight plans, I arrived a few hours early for my pick up. The facility was short on cars, so I understood that customers arriving at their designated time were prioritized. Regardless of my situation, the desk attendant went out of her way to make sure we received a rental as soon as possible. She even went out of her way to personally go to the returns and retrieve and wash a car that had just been returned. I greatly appreciated how she went “above and beyond”. The return of the vehicle was also very efficient. Overall very satisfied with my experience.",5,US,"October 06, 2023"
Initially I was given the wrong class of vehicle that I prepaid for and didn’t realize it until I got to the pickup counter.  The manger went above and beyond to accommodate me when he didn’t have the size of vehicle I reserved.  Everyone was excellent and I sincerely appreciated it.  I received a much nicer vehicle than I expected.  The car was clean and the process from pick up to return was seamless.,5,US,"October 11, 2023"

I rented the car from SFO. Although it required shuttle bus to pick the car. But the rental location is very close to the airport so the shuttle ride is very short. Basically you paid 30% less comparing if you rent the car from the airport,5,US,"October 09, 2023"
rental made easy and affordable. Great quality employees and great quality cars,5,US,"October 11, 2023"
"We verbally declined LDW coverage, but mistakenly initialed that box, and didn't notice the extra $23.99 daily charges until after we returned home.  The agent who rented the car to us was nice, and imagine this must have been an error on her part, but we are not happy about the extra charges for coverage we told her we did not want.",4,US,"October 09, 2023"
No problems picking up or returning the vehicle. Everything was satisfactory.,5,US,"October 14, 2023"
"Tell Valeria that my family says: THANK YOU!!!! She processed my vehicle return. She went above and beyond. She actually brought tears to my eyes once I made it home to review my invoice. My father had a stroke while we were in Chicago for his Dr’s appointments and I could have not anticipated how helpful she was in all that I had experienced during this rental. Pay her what she is worth!!! Keep her close to your customers!! Every time I return a rental she is nice but actually having to speak with her for assistance, I am more than happy to continue using Fox as my go to rental car company when I am in Chicago. It’s people like Val and Dennis who checked me in (he also helped dad and I with returning the vehicle that had a tire blow out during this rental) that keeps corporations in business.

"The staff were friendly and pleasant to work with. Very professional. Harold helped us and he was a great guy.My only complaint was that the vehicle we received had issues with the brakes. They rotors were probably needing to be worked on as things wobbled a little bit, but it was nothing that alarmed me or made me think the car was faulty.",4,US,"October 14, 2023"

"The Fox team takes customer service seriously. The team is friendly and helpful, I didn’t feel rushed or like I was being upsold. Their prices are fair and transparent. You can either fill up your rental’s tank yourself or you can pay Fox to fill up your car—for the exact same price. Their insurance comes in tiers but the team recommended our tier based on our travel plans. You’re paying for a budget-friendly, safe car with a luxury customer experience. I highly recommend Fox!",5,US,"October 06, 2023"

"We had a very good experience with Fox Rent a Car in Seattle.  The line at the rental counter was short, and we waited only about 5 minutes.  When we went down to pick up the car, we found the car that was assigned was larger than we wanted, so we asked at the desk downstairs if we could change it.  After a couple of minutes, we were given a new car that was just what we needed.  The car was clean and worked perfectly.  The return process was easy too and there were no hidden surprises.  It was our first time using Fox and we were impressed.",5,US,"October 06, 2023"

"We couldn't imagine a better experience than the one we had with Fox Rent a Car. On the day of the rental commencement Anna processed all formalities very smoothly and with a nice smile. But even more importantly we got the car that was a clear upgrade (with no extra charge) from the one that was requested. It was like being gifted right at the start. We had no issues whatsoever afterwards, the car was very comfortable and appropriate for our trip with the main goal of visiting Utah's National Parks. Returning the car was also super easy, and we took a shuttle to the airport without waiting. Our trip was a bit complex but I can honestly say that Fox made a great contribution to its success. Thank you.",5,US,"September 28, 2023"
I was able to book online. The service at pick up was fast and the lady was friendly.  I was in and out with no problems. Returning was easy as well. I would definately recommend.,5,CA,"October 06, 2023"

First time renting with Fox. It was a great experience.  The additional insurance coverage at the counter was ($70.00) for full coverage for the week. Very inexpensive compared to Sixt($35.00) per day and lower than my Deductible for my current plan. Got a good deal on the car through Priceline for a midsize SUV. I got complements from other motorists on how nice the car looked.  I was surprised at how nice it was too.  Hyundai Santa Fe with 4500 miles.,5,N/A,"October 03, 2023"

We saw a long line at the San Francisco Fox rental. There were people renting from them. When we booked to rent from them in Las Vegas we couldn't believe how cheap they are compared to the main rental places. Their location in San Francisco was right at the airport. In Las Vegas we had to take the free shuttle to get to them. Paying the $20 for the priority line saved us at least 30 min. The Chrysler 300 we ended up with had 700 miles. There was another renter there who said be sure to look at the tires because they rented a vehicle that had worn tires. That's a small inconvenience for saving 50% or more on a rental. Great value! They seemed to have a good crew which made the experience fun.,5,US,"October 01, 2023"
The service and car and value were great. The lication of the lot and time to get there was very long - give yourself an extra hour.,4,CA,"October 07, 2023"

"I reserved a premium car and none were available. Unsure why they give the option to reserve (and pay for) a type of vehicle if they aren’t going to hold one for you. I don’t know if the car I got was more money, but no financial restitution was offered. It was a highlight of my trip to drive my nephew around in a dodge charger (he loves cars!) and I got a boring Highlander instead. The car was super nice, clean and low miles, but not what I reserved. Why take a reservation if you don’t hold the car?",4,US,"October 03, 2023"

"I originally requested for a Camry and attendant went and checked the back lot. He came back and said a few minutes wait while they finished cleaning. He recommended the one I was going to rent as a brand new car and rides excellent. He was right. Also, the shuttle driver made room for me in the shuttle to airport. He had other passengers open up the last seat due to someone just having a backpack on it. I was running late. I was very happy with my experience.",5,N/A,"September 24, 2023"

I like being able to pick out my own car.  shuttle service availability is cool; would prefer that the shuttle could come directly to the Las Vegas airport rather than having to take a shuttle to the shuttle.,4,US,"September 27, 2023"
This was the worst experience I have had in 25yrs of travel. The agent at the counter was rude after waiting 2hrs in line to get a car. When we got to the counter they would not give us a car even though we had a reservation. The agent refused to even try to find a solution. They took our money and refused to refund it. We wound up going across the street and renting a car within 10min.,1,US,"August 11, 2023"
Good exper however it would be nicer if the car was located at the airport.,4,US,"September 27, 2023"
"We have used Fox many times and are always pleased with the service and vehicles. This particular trip, the check in clerk was rude, disrespectful, and not helpful. She assigned a car to us that was non-existent in the lot. However, we returned to the building and a different  clerk was super helpful and upgraded our vehicle with no problem and very quickly. Also, the shuttle drivers are always fun, friendly, and prompt.",3,US,"October 01, 2023"
"I had to get a last minute car rental, the rates at Fox were at least 100 less for the 3 days I was renting. So I took a chance. You have to take an additional shuttle bus from the rental car facility in Vegas, not sure if that is typical. The rentals have more miles and are more worn than some rentals I've had from other agencies. But it was clean and the price was right.",5,US,"September 26, 2023"
Fox price was the most competitive. I asked for an upgrade and the agent obliged at a reasonable upgrade cost. Transparent with cost and gas costs absolutely NO 'bait and switch'. I expected the car pick-up depot would be a distance from LAS. It was but I and other customers had to wait over thirty minutes for the Fox shuttle bus while other rental competitors had two shuttle buses come by in the time I waited. Their depots were located next to Fox.,4,US,"September 27, 2023"

"Info: rented via external website Carrental24 and got insurance from their website. Pickup: took a little longer than expected because the first shuttle was already full. Had to wait for about another 15 minutes to be picked upRenting process: was done pretty fast, I had a very nice lady taking care of me at the counter and explaining everything to me. She offered me the Insurance via Fox Rental but I already had a insurance so I declined. You‘d pay more for that if you don’t decline and already have a insurance on the car. Car: a beautiful 2020 dodge challenger in a nice red. I fell in love with the car! I was able to choose between two of them right at the beginning. Please check for markups and bumps at the beginning and take pictures! They will note that down before you leave the rental station. Return: was done in no time. Just drive the car back with a full gas tank unless you want to pay big money. You get a receipt right after and can go right to the shuttles. Thank you Fox Rental for this pleasurable experience. I‘d definitely rent again!",5,US,"October 05, 2023"

"Fox has the best prices, but not always the best experience. But the last few times I've rented... they've been SUPERB. Typically, I arrive and am given a vehicle that's not what i reserved or wanted. Usually under the guise of... ""we can give you a free upgrade"" ie because we don't have any more compact or mid sized SUV's were gonna give you giant Suburban or Monster pick up truck... even though it's just me driving. Not only is parking a nightmare in the city with a giant vehicle, but with gas at $5.60 a gallon... it's just a super waste to ""upgrade"" me. Anyway... that's the desk experience upon arrival. Down in the garage... Fox will work with you, if you're willing to wait to a few minutes to get the best vehicle suited to your need. Always clean, gassed and in great condition... the FOX team... especially Operations Manager Maricel Rutland...always delivers, and with friendly customer service. Highly recommend.",5,N/A,"October 07, 2023"

"Pick up at San Francisco after dark. 2 staff on duty.  Very slow service.  Pushed insurance and fastrak. In the 5431 miles we did we never went through one toll so the $12.99 a day would of been a total waste of money. The car, a Toyota 4runner was battered and scratched.  I felt embarrassed to drive it. As dark on pickup we didn't notice tires were underinflated. Car was nice to drive and did on average 21 miles to the gallon.  There is a Costco nearby, so would recommend filling up tank there and not paying Fox fuel price.  Vehicle return was quick and efficient, and the driver to the airport was a very pleasant lady.",3,US,"September 17, 2023"
"Ivan at the MIA office is very nice. We had dropped off one vehicle and was picking up another when I realised I forgot my passport. He said that he could not rent us the vehicle because we must have our passports even though I indicated we just dropped off one. My only suggestion to Fox is if you have a recurring customer that their documents be stored on file so they don’t have to keep presenting original documents each time, especially in our instance where we just dropped back a vehicle to pick up another one. We had to Uber back to our apartment and return with our passports. Ivan showed a high level of empathy when he realised how frustrated and tired we were and told us not to worry to full the tank on return to make up for the Uber. While the rental was only for about 15 hours and the gas needle hardly budged as it was just to make 2 trips, it was a great show of customer service, empathy and he left us with a great customer experience which is more important that the service itself. We would like to express our gratitude to Ivan for turning what started as a negative experience to a positive one. In terms of charges, we had to take the third party liability insurance as we were informed it is a mandatory requirement for rentals in Florida by law. There online chat is very responsive and I appreciated the consistency of the information. I was informed that third party liability is $13.20 per day in the chat, and at the office we were informed that the information we received was accurate. We also opted to pay for CDW via the third party booking site at $10 per day, as at the office this insurance can range from $13-$20 per day depending on the level of coverage you want. This can result to paying close to $35 per day for insurance coverage. I have booked with them several times already at the MIA office and have never had a problem with excessive charges or funds debiting from my credit card months after as some other rental company does.",4,US,"September 26, 2023"
Beatiful and affordable. No hassle rental.,5,US,"September 30, 2023"
Experience was good except for the 30 minute wait to get to the front of the line. By the time we got to the counter the line behind us was probably about 3 hours long with about 60 people in it.

"Everything was fantastic except for the pickup counter employee still trying to put liability insurance on the car for me to pay extra for, even though I let her know I've got full coverage on my own auto policy which covers rental cars. Besides that small detail that I caught and had her remove right before I paid, all was nice and smooth.",5,CA,"September 28, 2023"

The checkin is seamless and easy with her taking care of me. I rent alot due to travel for work. Fox process of pickup is a bit different and lengthy waiting for returns if there are no cars available even w a reservation.

When we dropped off the car, the whole process did not take longer than 2 minutes.We also only had to wait less than 5 minutes for the shuttle both when we were picked up from the airport and when we were dropped off.In terms of the car we rented, we got a Dodge Charger which we were very happy with and it did not let us down in spite of that we did a lot of driving throguh the mountains.",5,US,"October 02, 2023"
"A previous driver obviously smoked in the car, the front window was terribly smeared and the emergency brake was engaged at pick up with no one there to show me how to disengage it, so my trip was off to a very bad start!",3,N/A,"September 21, 2023"
"My car was ready!  At another company, a month earlier, I had to wait 3 hours for my car! Note: I strongly urge ownership to consider changing the name of the company from the current name to something more appropriate, considering today's political climate.

Great service. Professional and friendly staff. Reliable vehicles. Great price.,5,US,"October 02, 2023"
Check in was great without the typical high pressure sales to purchase additional insurance. Car was in great shape and exactly what we reserved. We were running late for flight home out of SLC so they expedited our return and rushed us to the airport! We made it with 5 mins to spare. They are offsite but instructions were very clear for shuttle service and a quick 10 min ride. Everyone was incredibly kind at check in and check out. 100% would use them again. Thanks Fox!!!,5,US,"October 02, 2023"
"the vehicle pick up counter at the airport was fully staffed and the line moved, as opposed to some other counters. If you start out on a positive note, chances are better it stays that way.",5,US,"September 22, 2023"

Employee Brevan really went out of her way to make sure we knew how to get out of the airport and get back.  She was very thoughtful in her inspection of teh vehicle at pick up,5,US,"September 23, 2023"
Great staff and rates. Easy pick up and super easy drop off.,5,US,"September 13, 2023"
A very positive experience!,5,US,"September 26, 2023"
"Read your contract before signing. The agent snuck insurance into our contract after we denied it because we purchased through the Priceline. Customer Service was no help, they will direct you there, make you wait 48 hours before a “manager” refuses to help. I read so many reviews after that talk about Fox rental sneaking fees into the contract. Also, be wary of any place that requires a credit card vs a debit card. This is intentional for the arbitration when filing a chargeback. I don’t want any other consumer to be fooled by their practice. The car was fine.",2,US,"September 26, 2023"
"Friendly and very helpful staff especially during pick. The cleanliness and type of car given to us, it was a brand new Hrand Cherokee! Very smooth pick up and drop off process. We appreciated the fact that we were given 12 hours to be able to pick ip the car since our flights got delayed.Overall, my hisband and I had a great experience with Fox. We would recommend!",5,US,"October 01, 2023"
Great vehicle and efficient pick up and drop off,5,US,"October 01, 2023"

"The staff is always friendly but every time I rent from Fox, they seem to have a new rule that requires I dish out more money.",4,US,"September 30, 2023"
The rental place isnt at airport. You have to take a shuttle bus to a sketchy offsite location. The driver drove like he ws in a 3rd world indy race. The checkin was good & smooth. The car was clean inside and out but smelt of sweat & body odor. The car operated very good. AC was very good which is a must in Florida. The return wasnt as easy. We had a family emergency and had to leave a day early. We had an issue with a wheelchair scooter we rented. We needed to leave it at the Car Rental for the scooter  company to pick up. The manager 1st didnt want us to leave because they could be liable. I understand i explained but i the renter is the liable one and only then she allowed it to be stored. Its a business i get it but also lets be a little understanding and compassionate. In the end she was and things all worked out.,3,US,"October 01, 2023"
It was always easy renting from Fox. I haven’t had any problems. Both pick-up and dropping off is very quick and with ease. I even had to extend my rental for a day and that went very smooth. Thank you for all the help.,5,US,"September 21, 2023"

"Everything from the reservation to the pick-up to the drop-off was super easy and stressfree.  I had spent hours in other rental car lines and was pleasantly surprised by FOX.

Tey doing it is great,4,US,"October 03, 2023"
"Overall great! This was my first time renting a car and after reading some of the reviews I was definitely nervous. But there were no hidden fees and a minimum deposit. They didn’t have the original vehicle that I had reserved but upgraded me at no charge. The only thing I didn’t like was you are left to look over the vehicle on your own, if it was daytime this would have been fine, but it was nighttime and the parking lot isn’t very bright. Also drop off wasn’t explained to me so that was slightly confusing, just to make sure I was doing the right thing.",4,US,"September 23, 2023"
Everything went super smooth from check in to check out and we loved the Rav 4 we rented. Shuttle service was amazing as well. Next rentals will definitely be with them if they are in that area.,5,US,"September 12, 2023"

"Fox provides best rental rates and cars are clean and updated.  Rental agent staffing is average on par with most rental car agencies.  Shuttle at SFO could use more shuttles as shuttles could only take about 1/3 of waiting clients.  They tried to set up a waiting line but not effective.  Snake rope waiting line would help.  Rental was Sept. 27-29, 2023",4,US,"September 27, 2023"

"From pick up to drop off, was an ideal experience. The pre-paid fuel option is a must. Everyone was helpful, it was fast, and the pay in advance option made it a great deal too.",5,AT,"September 19, 2023"
Pick up and return were super easy. Staff was friendly and the car was spotless and everything worked.I would have appreciated to know about all the insurance options already at the online reservation as it only showed one option online and then when picking up the car neccessary insurance options turned out to be more expensive that what showed online.Compared to other car rental companies the final price was still okay though.,5,US,"September 29, 2023"

"I was offered advanced fuel purchase, they said fuel is cheaper with them if I buy fuel outside. And I will be refunded for unused fuel. When I returned it I was charge FULL tank of gas despite using only half the tank, and I was charged additional $25 service fee which was never mentioned during pick up as shown on my receipt. I did not have time to argue since I have to catch my flight at ATL. Terrible experience!",1,US,"September 24, 2023"

"I rented a car from Fox Rent a car in Jacksonville, Fla. for a great price and the service there was amazing. I rented a car from Fox in Fort Meyers, Fla. in August 2023 a few weeks ago again at a great price but the front desk agent tried to upsell me on everything and was intimidating about it. I did pay for pre-paid fuel which I was billed $88 for. They did not give me my $150 security deposit back. I just got a email stating I did not get my deposit back because it was used for pre-paid fuel which they billed me $88 separately for! The also said the charged me for the toll road package that I did not agree to and is not on my rental agreement. My daughter and sat in traffic instead of using toll roads to avoid toll road fees. My point is I went with Fox because of the great rate but if they steal your security deposit it no longer is a great rate.",1,US,"August 30, 2023"

"This is the first, and last, time I rent from Fox. To begin, we arrived in Phoenix, AZ, and did not get the type of car we requested, a standard size, Toyota Camry-like car. Instead, we were presented with a Nissan Rogue, with no cover over the back luggage compartment and over 73,000 miles on it.  Driving out of the airport, we noticed the hood was loose. We pulled over to securely fasten the hood. We arrived at our first stop, Sedona, AZ, from Phoenix, and had a peaceful night. In the morning, with plans to explore, the car would not start. Contacting Fox roadside assistance, we were told that they would contact a service agency to jump start the car.  After three hours, and several phone calls back to Fox, a repair person showed up for the jump start. In doing so, he indicated that the battery was shot and probably wouldn't hold the charge. He suggested we take it in for a new battery.  More phone calls to Fox. They gave us the name of a service center to contact. We contacted them and were told that they could certainly change the battery, but they wouldn't guarantee that it would be done that day or even the next. On our own, we contacted several auto shops and found one that would replace the battery that day for us. We took the car over and had a late lunch while the battery was changed. When we picked up the car, we were told that the oil was low, the coolant was low, and the air filter was filthy. (Fox agreed to pay for the new battery as long as I had the record of the failed battery test which I had.) Another call to Fox demanding a drivable car. I was told to take the car back to Phoenix or to Salt Lake City and wait for an inspection to determine the drivability of the car. I was also told that if the car passed the inspection I would personally have to pay for the inspection and still drive the same car. Taking another day out of my trip was impossible so I decided to drive the car as it was, with my fingers crossed that it wouldn't break down on the trip. While driving, the dashboard warning lights continually came on indicating low tire pressure and faulty air bags. When I checked the door for the tag with the recommended tire pressure, the tag had been removed.  Also, there was no tire gauge in the car to check the tire pressure. I had to buy one! Once the tires warmed up and once the car had been running for a while, the dashboard warning lights went off. When I finally got to a place where I was staying for several days, I contacted several auto shops to see if they could address the problems with the oil, coolant, air filter and tire pressure. On the way, during a rainstorm I realized that the wiper blades were disintegrating and ready to fall off. Also, there was no washer fluid available in the car. After being told by several repair shops that they couldn't take the car until ""next week"" I finally found one that would take the car the next day. Next morning, in the shop, (Grease Monkeys in Durango, CO), the oil was topped off, coolant added, air filter replaced, wiper blades replaced, and tire pressure checked. (Thankfully, Fox did pay for this service.) The rest of my trip was without incident.  This car, with over 73,000 miles on it, should NEVER have been allowed to leave the rental agency. The worry and concern while driving this car was constant and should never have happened. Explanation given. I will never rent from Fox again.",1,US,"September 13, 2023"
Excellent prices. Customer service was awesome. Brand new vehicle. Easy return and charges.Planning to rent again in the near future.,5,US,"September 24, 2023"

Transfer didn't turn up at Las Vegas airport to take us to our hotel on the 11th September -‘phoned the 2 numbers on the email our travel agent gave us-the first number was the worlds quickest message in Spanish and the second number played ’don’t worry be happy!!’ Didn’t turn up to take us back to the airport either on 18th September -‘phoned them again-same result. Had to get taxi’s both times. Rubbish company-use at your peril.,1,US,"September 11, 2023"
"Picking up was done at fairly given time, considering the amount of people at the service desk.  The attendant was great, asking where I was going to be driving as this would allow him to suggest that Fox provided toll fee coverage that is is a given in any highway on the outskirts of Chicago (which I was not aware of) and providing recommendations on what to take considering traffic.   Miguel was his name.",5,US,"September 19, 2023"
"Great service while you are able to get the car, but if you get to Dallas after 10pm, they are closed and do not have a way for you to get the car rented, until the next morning after 8am.

"The entire staff at Fox, from the shuttle driver to the desk agent and the lot staff was great. We arrived around midnight, yet we were treated well, and still had a choice of vehicles.

Since fox has an off airport location in Las Vegas, it kept us away from the normal confusion and congestion. We will use Fox again for sure for future car rental needs!",5,US,"September 17, 2023"
"I had easy time in my rental, not a long wait and good people manning the front office. Vehicles are clean, newer and easy check out.",5,US,"September 15, 2023"
Go ahead and pay the toll charge assessed by the rental car company. It's a small fee to pay otherwise you will pay each time you go through a toll $15 each time. Pay a one-time per day and be done with it. There was a long line when I walked in to get the rental car that's my only issue. That and once again the tolls that Florida charges.,4,US,"September 23, 2023"

I was tired and expected the rental process to take some time but the staff made the experience quick and easy.  They were all very friendly and helpful. The car was very clean and the staff allowed me time to get acquainted with the car before diving off.  I did have a few questions concerning by bill afterwards but their help support was amazing, I even had someone reach out to me personally and we were able to get everything worked out.  I would definitely recommend them! Their dedication to customer service went above and beyond.",5,US,"September 16, 2023"

We were pleasantly surprised by how easy it all was. Even with the shuttle it was so easy and only added about 5-10 minutes to our travel plans. We will definitely be using Fox Rental in our future plans!,5,US,"September 18, 2023"
"Easy, great service, car was brand new.",5,US,"September 18, 2023"
Good overall. They could use another shuttle. And a few more employees when dropping off.,4,US,"September 17, 2023"
"My overall experience was great. The only thing I have an issue with is that you are told your such high $500 deposit will be refunded within 3-5 business days and they aren't being honest with that. I have rented several times and it has taken 15 days- 20 days to get my deposit back. And that is because I call over and over. Then told it can actually take up to 30 days.Fox just lets their time lapse and then it is sent back. Overall their rates are great, Customer service great and a very pleasant environment.",5,N/A,"September 11, 2023"
Good vehicles but make sure your dates are firm because if you prepay you will have to pay $100.00 cancellation fee. Customer service at the ORD location is great.,5,US,"September 22, 2023"

"My wife and I travelled to California for a gathering to celebrate the birth of our grandchild which was scheduled to begin at 1 PM.  The timing was close (only 2 hours from landing to the time for the gathering) but it was the best we could do.  I reserved a car with Fox and noted that the drive from the LA Fox office to the house where the party would be held was only 20 minutes.  This helped relieve my anxiety about the timing.  As it turned out our plane landed at the LAX airport at 11 am on Sunday, Sept 24, leaving us plenty of time (we thought) to get the car and get to the party.   When we entered the Fox office at 12:45 my heart sank.  There were at least 40 people in line and only three agents working.  20 minutes later a fourth agent arrived.  It took us until 12:40 PM to get up to the agent and sign in.  We were now late for the party.  Finally, we were signed in and proceeded to the garage to collect our car.  Anther long line. It was explained that our car, which we had now waited almost an hour for, was not “ready.”  It needed to be “cleaned” and we must wait our turn.  “See, all these people are ahead of you, and they have been waiting.”  We said we would take it no matter how dirty it was.  The agent politely explained that this was not possible.  The wait was another ½ hour.  By the time we got to the gathering that we had travelled all the way across the country to attend, the guests were leaving and we had missed several of the people we came to see.There is no system to warn the customer ahead of time.  We could have rented another car, albeit at a higher price, had we been warned at the airport that there would be a wait of over an hour to get our car.  Once you have waited for the shuttle bus and been dropped off at the Fox site (35 minutes), it is too late. They have sucked you in and you are at their mercy.  To get another car at that point would easily take at least an hour not counting the wait for the Uber.  This happens regularly, so I am told.  The line still numbered 40 people when we finally left the facility.  Another shuttle was just pulling up. The lack of a warning is willful disregard of the customer.Another complaint: The model I reserved was not available.  We were given instead the civilian equivalent of an Abrams tank that we could not park anywhere.  No price adjustments. One thing I must add:  ALL of the people at the facility were respectful, cheerful and apologetic.Still…Not fair.  Customer abuse by Fox management.",1,US,"September 24, 2023"
"DISLIKELocation of paperwork counter is on first floor north but the car itself is obtained on 2nd floor south. No signs to assist you in finding these locations, but all the other rental car places have signs. I had to do a lot of walking to get to my car because instructions on website said to go to 2nd floor, so I went there first, only to be told to go back downstairs to get the paperwork first. Then I had to back upstairs on opposite side to get the car I rented online.LIKEThe employee lady at the 2nd level walked me to the rental car and was very informative and super nice.Car rental rate was the best of all companies.",3,US,"September 17, 2023"

"Great check in, good price and the car was very clean.   However, I have little patience with employees who don’t give a damn about their customers or their job duties.

Fox had my car ready on time for pick up and was waiting on us at the airport to provide transportation to the rental center.

Customer Service was Excellent. Car radio didn't work as completely as it should have.,4,US,"September 16, 2023"
Had a good experience picking up the car though the 'upgrade' to a standard size car from a compact was not an upgrade considering expensive gas in California. Had asked for a Yaris and got a Camry.Drove the car to Yosemite where I was booked for four nights at Curry Village. Opened trunk with key in parking lot and alarm went off.  I do not own a car. I was absolutely  mortified. From then on out of an abundance of caution I only opened the trunk from the inside after unlocking the car with the fob.Would love to silence the lock and unlock functions but I don't know how.This may be more of an issue for Toyota.,2,MX,"September 04, 2023"

Booked through expedia and did not know when i booked you had to have a credit card and not a debit card when picking up the car. i do not have a credit card so i was stranded at the airport with no ride and was told i would get refunded by fox but i had to go through expedia to get the refund. what i am being told by expedia is that Fox is telling them they are not refunding it. They have told me twice i would get refunded but won't refund it.,1,US,"September 05, 2023"
"Since Fox is much less than expensive than the big brands, I was expecting a lesser experience and I was willing to give up a little posh to save a little cash, but I was pleasantly surprised from the agent at the kiosk to the car provided and the excellent customer service from beginning to end. I will definitely use Fox again and look to them before even thinking about booking with a big brand. Thank you for the excellent service and experience.",5,US,"September 07, 2023"

The total amount will be 1.5 times the amount displayed at the time of booking. If this incident happens again, I don't want to use it again.

The rental agent was sneaky with her sales tactics. Make sure you read your contract before signing. Don't just sign in the highlighted areas. Don't take their word for anything. They receive a commission on selling extra options. Remember that it's a option. The manager help me get into a car after 3 attempts.1st was filthy.

"Do not use FOX Rental. Terrible service!Although their cars listed on the website are relatively cheaper than others, their service and information are misleading customers. The Rental Car Agent at LAX forced customers to purchase an insurance wasn’t required and added on insurance service that customers has not agreed on. And they did not provide any documentation of what they will bill you. So they can obtain your deposit and can deduct more fees from your card.When we picked up our car, they did not offer you the same range of car you booked for unless you requested. When you return their car, they will ask you to sign for the bills with wrong items and misled you with the bad presentable invoice. I contacted the billing team via email and called them through international numbers, they are slow to respond nor update unless you chase them. One of the billing agent in order to get things done, admitted their mistakes and offer their store credits but not a refund the amount they charged you. Think before book!",1,US,"August 10, 2023"

"We had a great experience with Fox at pickup.  The car was right at the Ft Lauderdale terminal.  At first, our instructions were to take a shuttle, but we were more than happy to find out we did not have to do that.  Returning the car was easy, although there was a little confusion.  We pulled up to the booth and no one was there.  We waited a little and then walked to a different booth and gave the person the keys.  When we were leaving we noticed someone had gone over to the car and was looking all over for the keys.  We let them know where to get them.  Other than that, our whole experience was very easy and I would rent from Fox again.",5,US,"August 30, 2023"

I do love that the online service is great. It offers many discounts. My complaints would be more in the airport service. The Fox counter has a long waiting line. There are not enough check in employees. They are also not very courteous and compassionate.,3,US,"September 02, 2023"
My car rental was great because Nathan and Javier always help me out on choosing the best car. They’re very friendly and have a smile when helping. They acknowledge me. They have that attitude like we’re here to help you. The vehicle was clean and reliable. I didn’t use the shuttle bus. Great and fast service.,5,US,"August 30, 2023"
"small shuttle, no air conditioning, very slow pickup process due to long line and few employees. The car was OK, clean and in good condition. dropoff was fast, but had to wait for the next shuttle. It was a traffic jam at LAX arrival (not fox fault though",3,US,"August 30, 2023"

"Note my revision at the bottom.I am generally very careful about renting a car and the prices quoted, but you need to be very careful with Fox (and other low-cost rental companies).  I told them I did not want liability insurance and yet they put it on the contract. You don't see what you're signing on the pin pad until afterwards so be sure to look at the paper copy. I didn't notice it. They charged me $13 a day extra for rental liability insurance I did not want.  Don't trust what the agent says. Only the words in the contract count. In addition, they charge a large early fee (yes, they charge you if you are too early! $35) or late return fee even if it's just a little more than an hour either way.  They charged me a late fee of $40 (instead of just another day's rental at $15/day) when I was 90 minutes late and charged for another day's liability insurance that I didn't want in the first place for a total of about $50.Calling customer service does no good. They don't have any ability to change anything since it is all on the contract and they are just a call center. They have bad business practices even though they are legally covered.The car itself was fine.UPDATE Sept 15, 2023: Got an email from the manager of the location and I explained my problems. She corrected the problems and issued a refund cheerfully without question. This left me with a better feeling about Fox.",4,US,"September 09, 2023"
Great service and everything always goes smoothly,5,DE,"September 01, 2023"
"SFO. The pickup experience was a pain in the ass, but well, that can happen from time to time. But the real suprise was when they did not refund the security deposit, I had to call to know what's going on with it and they said that I only prepaid for part of the contract and not all (when I clearly paid for the full contract online with credit card). Feels a very shady move. And I had another experience with another rental company and everything was smooth, and plain simple... this is not a nice company to rent for, never again!",1,US,"September 04, 2023"
"I had a great experience with Fox Car Rental out of Denver. Walked right up to the shuttle and picked up right away. Waited shortly once at the location and was greeted warmly by Chris. He helped me find a great car and I ended up stepping into a brand new (1650 miles) Dodge Challenger. The car was perfect for my time in Colorado and performed perfectly. On my way back to Denver, Interstate 70 closed unexpectedly because of a forest fire. I called immediately to let them know and they proactively extended my rental with no extra charge. Once I was able to get to Denver, the drop off was quick and easy and I was charged exactly what I was expecting. Factor in the price of my rental, I'd say it was above and beyond my expectations. i know there is a some polarity with peoples experiences, but mine was very good and next time I'm renting out of Denver, I will be choosing Fox again. Thank You!",5,CA,"September 03, 2023"

I liked the price of the rental for a week. Didn't like taking two shuttles to get to Fox. Could work on cleaning a bit more eg windows. Dropping off was easy. Staff waiting to clear you as you drive in.,4,US,"August 26, 2023"

"LAX location. When I went to pick up the car, the sales agent was friendly at first until I refused his aggressive up selling. He wanted me to upgrade to a minivan and prepay for FastTak despite me clearly telling him clearly I did not need either of these things. I did agree to a hefty insurance fee as apparently California state law requires this and it’s not included in the price you pay when booking online. A couple of days after dropping the car back to Fox we discovered he’d added road side assistance to my bill without my consent! I’ve spoken to their billing team and have received a verbal apology and am waiting for a manager to process the refund.",1,US,"August 31, 2023"
"Windshield on the vehicle was not clean very well. We had to clean the indsude of it again after getting to our destination. Otherwise, car was clean otherwise as expected.  The car was very easy to drive and handled very well. We were very impressed with that type of vehicle. However, the rental process took quite some time. There was stuff in there that didn’t want to help out with other as  one person working at the counter and four people waiting to rent. When buses come in normally all hands on deck however, that location didn’t seem to care about that. That was my only frustration with renting a car from this company. We were driving up to Yellowstone ,after flying into Denver, which took an hour for us to get everything situated with the rental before leaving. We wish the transition could’ve gone smoother and quicker, especially since I had a prepaid for the rental car and had all the information in the computer prior to getting to the counter.",4,US,"August 29, 2023"

"The car was a compact and brand new, affordable, and staff got us through it in good time.  I do recommend getting insurance through a third party or your own because it's way more expensive getting it with the rental companies.",4,US,"September 03, 2023"
I would recommend fox rental. They are very professional and clean. Easy process. I like the fact that you can choose your own car at time of pick up and just drop it off.. very pleased.,5,US,"August 29, 2023"

"They lie. They change the price AFTER your pre-paid reservation. RECORD ALL CALLS WITH THIS COMPANY!!! We PRE-paid to rent a small SUV at SFO airport for $700, we were told by phone it would be $200 extra to return the vehicle in a different city than the pick up. When we arrived at the rental location to pick up our vehicle, the agent gave us the run around on the vehicle we had selected, THEN said it would be $2,000 additional for the rental ""due to supply and demand"" plus $4,000 extra ON TOP OF THAT to drop it off at the different city. ""There's no notes in your reservation."" Make no mistake, this is on purpose and is geared to mislead the customer, then charge an outrageous fee when they think they have you cornered.We went online with Budget and secured the exact same rental, with return at the different city: $979. Not $7,000. Will never EVER attempt to rent from Fox car rental ever again.Confirmation# FFX03AF118",1,US,"September 08, 2023"
My first contact with Esmeralda was very quick professional and friendly thanks you Fox for staff like Esmeralda!!,5,US,"August 29, 2023"
"I've rented from many other companies in the past, some on the more budget side but mainly the bigger names. We wanted to have a car for several days but knew we wouldn't be using it a ton and so just didn't want to have to pay a lot.  The online booking experience was great... I was waiting for the rate to suddenly skyrocket because so often what you see is really a teaser rate and then by the time all the fees are added on you might as well have rented from Hertz. But pleasantly surprised that, while there were a few fees, the rate was pretty much the same.  Similarly, the pickup process was smooth and fairly painless with the only slight complaint being that there were 10-12 people waiting in line and only two people serving. But when I spoke to the guy who checked me out there was no hard sell to get the insurance, he was excited to tell me that you guys now had a gas pump on site and so just bring the car in empty and the price for gas should be the same or cheaper than at a local gas station. Car was clean and very nice. On our return... I had intended to get gas before returning, but just forgot, but was pleasantly surprised again that when I received notification of my final bill the gas price was pretty much what I had thought I would pay to fill it myself.  Overall an amazing experience!!",5,US,"September 05, 2023"

"The car was great! better than I had anticipated in terms of size and comfort. The only thing I was displeased with was the explanation about tolls in the area. I tried to explain where I would be traveling to, and was led to believe there would be a lot more tolls, and I needed to purchase the daily pass, which significantly added to my expense. I felt that the rep and company was just trying to make money off of me",4,US,"August 29, 2023"

"They are a fraud company which I didn't know before renting a car from them.  They charged me $91.25 on Aug 24 (11 days after returning the car), even after sending the deposit money back on Aug 13.  They haven't informed me anything about it.  It would go unnoticed if I didn't check my credit card statement.  At first, the representative said I paid for 5 days and I returned the car after 5 days.  But, I took the car on Aug 8 (10:57 pm), and returned the car on Aug 13 (8 am).  Then she said, it was the insurance charge.  But, I paid already paid $514.8 which included the insurance.  Then she said that the car was excessively dirty for which they charged $75 or so which is absurd.  I cleaned the car before returning.  They haven’t showed me any photo or informed me anything about this before charging me even.  They just directly take the money out of my credit card.  They have now sent a mail saying that they will again charge me for toll which I was not informed at all too.  Previously, I rented in FL, and I paid the toll before taking the car, it was already included in the bill.  But, Fox rent-a-car is asking me to pay $15 administrative fee for each toll which is again absurd.",1,US,"August 24, 2023"

"Really bad cars. Out of all car rentals I've ever had, never had so many worn down, bad smelling, damaged cars. They've always been new and clean. Even the guy at pick up admitted it smelled like something had died in there, and after smelling 6 cars I found one that was decent. So many damages everywhere so you had to take videos to make sure no one came after you. I got lucky that I was there before one of the shuttles, so only had to wait 30 minutes to get a car, but the line was long. The car rental was 30 dollars but the medium coverage insurance was 53 so don't let the price fool you.",2,US,"September 03, 2023"

"The wait for the shuttle was long and even longer at the counter when we got to the office. However, the staff are friendly and when we finally talked to someone at the desk, things went smoothly.

"We made a car rental reservation through Expedia for a rental car in Atlanta, GA. The reservation was for a mid-size sedan for $249 for a week. On arrival, Fox Car rental informed us that the vehicle, class, and price for our reservation could not be honored. We were forced to pay nearly double ($429) At the rental counter, we were told that this was because they were being forced to upgrade us to a Honda SUV. Since we had already flown across the country and were meeting friends for this trip, we were forced to take what they could give us. The vehicle they gave us was NOT an upgrade. It was NOT a Honda. It was not an SUV. It was a Hyundai Kona, which could not even hold our bags in the back end. Neither Expedia nor Fox are being helpful in resolving our complaint.",1,US,"August 28, 2023"

"Loved the car we got, the staff was extremely friendly and grateful for our business, to be honest I never heard of the company but I will be coming back to them often as they are willing to change car if the option you got isnt up to your standard, you can tell they want to put customers first, car second which is always a great sign, the only thing that can cause inconveniece for anybody who does not arrive at airports on time is that the wait time for shuttle can be long.",5,CA,"August 26, 2023"

"When we book on the website everything works and the rates seem ok. But when we arrived to pick up the car, THE ROBBING AND THE SCAM BEGIN. From the profile of the employees chosen for this role, you can already see that it's ALL A STRATEGY. Employees ARE THREATENING YOU all the time with terrorism that Mexico [is the worst place in the world and that you are not covered by any insurance ever. AFTER A LOT OF INSISTENCE.... YES....AROUND 1 HOUR PER CUSTOMER!... They settle for the cheapest insurance that already 5 times the rent value and tell you at the end, only third parties are covered, your car does not. CORRUPT COMPANY, MUST PAY THESE POOR PEOPLE BY COMMISSION.",2,ID,"August 17, 2023"
"Fox Car RentalI never write reviews but needed to write this one. After reading poor reviews for Fox, I was worried and thought I made an error in selecting. Well, our experience was spectacular. The airport van was waiting to pick us up as soon as we got off the plane. Didn’t wait an hour as one reviewer wrote. The van was new and had plenty of seats. As opposed to broken or missing seats that they had to stand and hold on. We had no problem at the pickup counter. Cynthia gave us a free upgrade and lots of suggestions on what to see in Colorado. She was friendly and funny.  Then upon our return it went smoothly. As soon as we arrived to drop off the airport van was waiting to take us to the airport. Off to the airport then we realized that we had left our laptop in the SUV! We told the van driver. He called the drop-off and told them. We returned to the Fox drop-off and they had our laptop waiting for us at the door. The van driver came in to see if we had it and we said yes. We ran back to the same van with the same van driver. We were so grateful to everyone that works at Fox, gave the van driver a healthy tip. We all kind of bonded over this. Fox ROCKS!!",5,US,"August 23, 2023"

"Staff was fantastic! Efficient and friendly. Pick-up and drop-off very easy.The problem was with the condition of  our vehicle. The exterior was covered in dents and scratches, the windshield had water spots that would not come off. The inside of the windshield was FILTHY. The floor on the driver’s side had a large hole in it. It had almost 70k miles and is ready for retirement.I would definitely try to rent from FOX again but would try hard for a better vehicle.",4,N/A,"August 18, 2023"
"Felisha and Jason are always a pleasure to see when I need a rental in Austin.  The vehicles are always very clean and they have a nice selection as well.

"It was ok. This location at the time of my visit was very busy and did not have cars available. Had to wait for a vehicle only to get a vehicle that I did not reserve and didn't want, however the manager made up for my inconvenience by offering me a free tank of gas and made a note of it on the vehicle inspection sheet, which made me feel better because I can now return it empty. It was one of those vehicles that required a lot of gas. On my return I explained to the returning attendant what transpired and showed her the piece of paper where the note was made and she assured me that I will not be billed for the fill up. The next day I checked my email for the receipt and there it was $170.xx in refueling cost added to my invoice. Now I had to call customer service luckily I kept the paper where the note was made and email it to them, then I was issued a credit.",4,CA,"August 24, 2023"

"I love the employees at Fox. A rental car is just a car unless it has a problem, but the folks you deal with in the interaction are key to the experience. Fox either somehow hires all the best people or has a great training program.",5,US,"August 24, 2023"
Good customer service,4,IT,"August 27, 2023"
During pickup process I had the impression to be “manipulated” to acquire services and I had not sufficient knowledge of US rules to understand if they were obligatory or optional (e.g. plate toll),3,US,"August 06, 2023"
Lisa was the best very sweet and helpful,5,IT,"August 17, 2023"
The cars I've rented from Fox have always been available immediately. Friends who have rented from other companies have been told at pickup that no cars were available and have had to wait hours before a car came on the lot. Perhaps I've been lucky. Staff have been helpful and informative. The shuttle to and from the SFO Car Rental Center takes five minutes so being off airport has never been a problem for me. Good pricing. Highly recommend.,5,SX,"August 10, 2023"

"Wait for a long time for the bus to arrive. Otherwise, everything else was smooth and good.",4,US,"August 18, 2023"
"There were three confusing elements I had to deal with 1) the directions said to find the shuttle by going west or east or something like that.  I had no idea which way is west or east so ended up going to the wrong end of a vast garage. 2) there are two shuttles, a) an off airport shuttle area for vans that go to hotels and b) an off airport shuttle area for vans that go to rental car agencies.  I initially went to the wrong shuttle area 3) I thought one shuttle would swing by all the different off airport rental car agencies.  I got on the first shuttle and luckily it was the one going to Fox.  It was clearly marked as a Fox shuttle but I did not notice until I was on it and it was driving away.All that being said, the car was great and the people were great.",4,US,"August 12, 2023"
"DO NOT RENT HERE. They never offered any option to pay tolls, I was here on business and I would have paid for electronic tolls. Months later I get a bill for $4.50 in tolls and over $100 in Fox ""administrative fee"". The total bill? $125.90 . The cars were filthy, dented, scratched and falling apart. None of them had GPS. I thought I got a good deal in price, by the time I paid EXTRA for GPS and for these few tolls, I ended up paying over $300 a day to rent a crappy car that smelled so bad I had a headache the entire time. I am exhausted and disgusted with this company. Just got a call from a collection department on toll charges, I cannot even believe how bad and stressful this made my business trip.",1,US,"January 23, 2023"
"I received exceptional service from the check in counter from Vu and anytime of pick-up from Op. Manager Maricel M.The staff tried their best to make sure our family of 6 received a comfortable and clean ride, they even offered us a spared iPhone charging cable to use for the duration of our trip (I did personally thanked Maricel upon returning the charging cable).  I know they don't have to offer up any spear stuff, but they did it genuinely when they learned my phone is low on power after a transcontinental flight.Top notch and friendly customer service even at the gate out and return processes.  It is rare to see so many staff working happily and in fantastic teamwork nowadays... well, I found it at Fox car rental - Seattle (Sea-Tac) Airport.",5,US,"August 17, 2023"

"Rented a car from LAX location. Pick up went relatively smoothly, the vehicle we booked wasn’t available, but our service rep Thomas was excellent and got us an upgrade at a good price. Vehicle was clean and comfortable. My issue is having prepaid through a third party, there were additional fees we weren’t aware of until pick up and we ended up paying more than expected after returning the vehicle. Don’t recommend prepaying.",4,US,"August 16, 2023"

"Unfortunately, I had the displeasure of being looked after by a dishonest salesperson at the Fox Car Rental desk at their Orlando, FL location.  I had basically reserved a hire car using a 3rd party site.  Upon arrival to the Fox Orlando, FL location (after a long day of travelling from Canada), I confirmed my details etc.  The part to be aware of is to ensure that you get the counter sales rep to explicitly run through the whole invoice before you electronically sign the invoice.Ultimately, the counter sales rep guy conveniently omitted mentioning that he had included 3 optional extras: Loss Damage Waiver (LDW), Supplemental Liability Insurance (SLI) and PlatePass (ATS) in my invoice.As this is signed for using an electronic screen, all he said to me was can you write you initial on the screen without explaining that I was inadvertently signing for an additional £400 of optional extras (which I didn't need) to be added to my invoice.This is really disgraceful and dishonest, please be mindful of using this company.I've also contacted customerservice at foxrentacar dotcom to escalate this malpractice, but as of yet no meaningful response to my dispute/ complaint.",1,US,"August 07, 2023"
"Check in was not good, very odd process.  I had rented due to the jeep advertised but of course there were no jeeps. I asked the Fox attendant if there are ever any jeeps and she said ""no"". Why does Fox advertise them so much if there aren't any? The similar vehicle was newer and worked well for the trip.Return process was total opposite experience thank check in, quick and easy.",3,N/A,"August 20, 2023"

"The tolls package is a rip off. Don’t buy it. The agent at the desk should have been more upfront and clear about how it works. I didn’t buy it and am glad I didn’t. It would have been a rip off as I didn’t incur a single toll, yet the lady made it out to sound like I would.",4,US,"August 11, 2023"

"Not sure about the bad reviews. The women at the counter got us in an out fairly quickly. No pressure sales. I think most should do their research before they get there. Like if you are fully covered on your insurance policy you don’t need insurance. But if you don’t have collision, theft etc you need it. Also, you can get fast track for tolls instead of paying fox. It made sense for us because we only went over one toll bridge. If you plan on going over the GGate numerous times then I’d just get it at fox. And fill your tank before you return it. There’s a gas station right down the street. If not don’t complain when they charge you. Do your due diligence. All good here👍",4,CA,"August 15, 2023"

"Price of Fox rental in Seattle was excellent. I’d a 30 minute delay in getting the minivan I’d reserved, but I was offered other options. I waited and got the minivan, which I was very happy with.

"We chose FOX online for their great low prices and promotions for our trip to sunny Los Angeles. When we arrived at LAX airport at 8:30 pm we waited for the Fox shuttle to arrive where the signs indicate « shuttles » just outside the doors, it took some time, maybe 20-30 minutes, but be patient, there are a lot of shuttles and huge traffic at the LAX airport, but the waiting is really worth it. The driver is friendly and helps with the luggage, and after a 10 minute drive, he drops us right across the street from the Fox rental building, just a few steps from the door, then we waited in line around 30 minutes, since there were about 3 families ahead of us.  We already made our reservation online so it wasn’t long before we signed papers at the counter and got the car and drove to our location. When it was time to take our flight home, the drop-off for the car was super easy, they open at 5:00 am so we arrived at the counter and they told us where to drop the car, it was very fast, since there were no damages to the car, the inspection is very quick, and just a few steps away we wait 5 minutes for the shuttle, and the driver then announces the airline for our departure and drops us at the door. Don’t forget to tip the driver! 💕",5,CA,"August 05, 2023"
Easy to pick and Easy to deliver,5,US,"August 08, 2023"
It was super cheap to rent with Fox.  The price was unbelievable.  It cost me more to park my car at O;Hare than it did to rent a car in Atlanta.,5,US,"August 16, 2023"
"Everything was going well… I kindly declined the SunPass, Insurance and Pre-Paid Fuel…. I dropped it off on time, with a full tank and STILL got charged $50.90 for “Pre-Paid Fuel”… it’s upsetting and it feels like you just want to find something extra to charge me for. Last year, I dropped it off on time and with a full tank.. I got charged $25 for “rental fee”…. The truck I got, was nice, a little interior cleaning would go a long way… the truck started feeling a little rough (shaking on idle/rough disengagement when the auto shut off goes off) mid-week, a little maintenance would go a long way as well. The shuttle to the airport was outstanding this year, there was practically no wait time. The rates are still one of the best, if not the best in Orlando. I just don’t like being charged for something that I don’t agree with or that’s not explained to me.",3,US,"August 12, 2023"
"Fox had great options and great prices. The vehicle we got was better than usual for the category (minivan) and had a lot of higher end features. Pickup and dropoff were easy, too.",5,US,"August 12, 2023"

"Overall, a very good rental experience.  The counter and Booth service were very good. The Plate pass option was far more expensive than paying the actual tolls would have been.",4,US,"August 06, 2023"
"Most cars have very high mileage and are usually not very clean at all. I had a reservation for a full-size car, but the rental agent kept trying to make me take a 2 door car. I explained numerous times that I was renting a mobility scooter and also had other people with me which would make a two door car extremely inconvenient. He finally gave me a really dirty 4 door Dodge Charger. I had to drive to California later in the week, so I went back to the location and spoke with a manager who put me into a more reasonable four-door, full-size car. There was vibration in the front end which I think was from the brakes on that car which also wasn’t all that clean inside either. I was just grateful to get a car that was more reasonable on gas Not the best rental experience, but not the worst either.",2,US,"August 05, 2023"

Only issue was once the paperwork was signed it took a long time for our vehicle to be ready.  It was a busy day and only seemed to be one person to go get the vehicle run it through a car wash and bring it to us.  There was a line so things took a while,4,US,"August 08, 2023"

I am being charged for an early return plus two hours... doesn't make sense!,3,US,"August 08, 2023"
Cheapest tires were very loud on the road especially on the freeway. Pick up desk tried to charge me per day to have my wife as authorized driver but when I stated that their policy showed she is free she shrugged off her effort to get more money 🤑 and said as a one time courtesy she will wave the fee. Good try. Otherwise everything else was good for the price!,4,US,"August 05, 2023"
"When I had a late flight and was unable to get my original booked vehicle from a different provider, Fox stepped up.

The process of picking up and returning the vehicle as well as the shuttle service.,5,N/A,"August 10, 2023"
"I rented a car from Fox using the pre-pay option thinking it would simplify matters. Unfortunately, 4 days before I was due to travel and rent the vehicle, my elderly mother was hospitalized and I canceled my travel plans. I canceled my rental via the Fox website, which is how I rented the car, and then decided to call Customer Care to see about a refund. The representative transferred me to the Billing department; I spoke with Maydel and after a long hold, she said I would need to provide a copy of my mother's hospital records in order to get a refund. When I questioned her re: HIPAA, she said it was the company's policy. I then asked to speak to a supervisor. After holding, she returned to the line and said no supervisor was available. I asked to leave a message and have a supervisor return a call to me. The representative said that ""they don't do that"". bottom line: In addition to not being able to speak to a supervisor, it is this company's policy to violate the federal HIPAA laws which are protective of one's healthcare privacy. Move on to another car rental; this one is a sham.",1,CA,"August 18, 2023"
They are doing a good service  I really recommend.,5,US,"August 12, 2023"

"The booking was very cheap even during peak demand and with a different drop-off location. The car was simple but clean and reliable. Easy drop-off at San Diego airport with free shuttle to terminals. The major problem is insurance, which you usually need to buy at pickup: it was very expensive (cost as much as renting the vehicle itself) and with only a few unclear options.",4,US,"August 06, 2023"

"I was nervous with all the reviews but honestly had a great experience! The two shuttles are not bad at all. Pick up was very quick and easy. Rental price was way better than competitors. Only downside was when we took the shuttle back at night, the driver was super rude and mean. He was very passive aggressive to my family member because he wasn’t putting the suitcase in the correct spot. Definitely could have been friendlier about it. Besides that the rest of the experience was great.",5,US,"August 12, 2023"
"Great car and very transparent for all the expenses up front when signing the contract. Also, helped me explain how I can reduce toll charges and fuel charges based on my usage of the rental. Pick up and drop off at SFO was covered in the shuttle, hassle free.",4,US,"August 01, 2023"

My overall experience was good. I just didn’t like how crowded it was in the customer area and it took over 30 minutes for me to get my car I paid for online. I heard one of the workers say they had to wait for the mechanics to complete oil changes in the cars which was being done at the last minute. Other than that everything was cool.,4,US,"August 10, 2023"
"This was the worst experience I have ever had with renting a car. I have been traveling for 30+ years and this is definitely the worst. We waited 1 hr 45 min in line just to get to the counter. When we did, the agent would not give us a car because we were early. I was willing to take ANY car they had available. When I asked for a different car he became rude and said he could not help us, even though there were cars available on the lot. (Two people in line in front of us left without their cars due to other reasons. )Not only was our experience bad, but they refused to give us a refund. Do not rent from Fox.",1,US,"August 10, 2023"

"Due to a flight change, we caught an earlier flight and arrived in Las Vegas three hours before our scheduled car pick-up. As such, our chosen vehicle was not ready. Thankfully, the check-in folks were able to get us into another vehicle that met our needs. The FOX shuttle service to and from the airport was easy and with no delays. The one caveat was with the vehicles readiness for our trip. Midway through our trip, I had to replenish the windshield wiper fluid reservoir and the routine service/oil change indicator message came on. Lastly, the interior of the windshield had a haze that I had to clean to see clearly. None of these were of major concerns to me as I am familiar with vehicle maintenance, but these should have been taken care of prior to the rental. Overall, we were happy with the, price, car and the service from FOX given our early arrival but a little more car care should be observed.",4,US,"July 24, 2023"
Price and service were great. Being off site from the airport was a little inconvenient but shuttle was prompt and made it not so bad.,4,US,"July 28, 2023"

"Rented one out of DIA. Waited in line for 1.5 hours and got a 2 year old car in bad shape. They tried to stick me with damages to the vehicle upon return. To note all the damages both inside and out would have taken me an additional 20 minutes. Should have taken pictures of the entire car. Also, told them I wanted the pike pass. Just got a bill from them with a $9.20 toll amount but a $30 administrative fee. Ridiculous!",1,US,"July 22, 2023"
Everything about our experience was fantastic!!,5,CA,"July 31, 2023"

It was a great experience while pickup and drop off the vehicle at Fox location. I didn’t expect the process would be so smooth and easy.

"1st day of rental and last day of rental (only times used) emergency panel lights to pull over/malfunction  came on. One was at night and scary and the other daytime. Telephone number for help on contract had last 2 numbers cut off.Nice stranger helped me the first time and I just drove thru the second warning worried to the return area as I was downtown SA. Marcus at the Fox desk was very nice, as I showed him all the problem pictures. He promised an adjustment on my bill that never happened. I called Fox, uploaded the pics again and another promise missed now with Vince (supervisor). No return call, email or anything. They seems real concerned when speaking with them but no follow thru. I do not recommend any elderly people use Fox Rentals as unreliable cars and people are all they offered me and is a dangerous mix for us elderlys.  Patty K",1,US,"July 27, 2023"

"We liked them the first time on a previous trip to Las Vegas so decided to go with Fox again and just like before, they were great. Excellent value, no hassles, fast pickup and return, super convenient shuttle and all the people are very nice and personable. Also, their facility is ""off-site"" (away from main airport rent-a-center) which is less nerve racking because you don't have to deal with crazy traffic there coming or going, the shuttle takes you to there and then right back later.",5,US,"July 26, 2023"

"Rented a car from Fox via my employer's benefits platform, but when I showed up at the car rental I was told I didn't have a valid reservation since same-day reservations were not permitted, even though my e-mail said 'your reservation is confirmed'. The associate offered to change the reservation to something more than 2-times the price. I may be wrong, but this occurs to me to be a so-called ""switch and bait"" scam. I declined the offer. Apart from that, I perceived the associate as rude as she kept using the phrase ""you have to understand, that ..."", but I wasn't there to be schooled about the car rental industry and simply wanted to pick up the car. When I declined, she told me I would have to try to get my money back from the rental platform, which I am currently hoping to be able to.",1,CA,"August 04, 2023"

Everything from start to finish was seamless.,5,US,"July 27, 2023"
"Booked on Priceline as a noncancellable, nonmodifyable reservation. Arrived at the counter and they charge me double the amount in other fees that were not optional add-on's. Either I forefeit the car and they still charge my card, or take the car and they still charge my card. I return the car and they increased the charge by another $50, citing various convenience fees and an ""early fee"" for returning the car before the due time (I certainly picked it up after the beginning of the reservation). Will never book with Fox nor Priceline again. The cost would have been lower if I had gone to the more reputable brands despite a higher advertised on Priceline...at least places like Avis, Budget, Hertz, etc don't deceive you with silly fees.",1,US,"August 04, 2023"

The older sales clerk made the experience great. Absolutely loved his vibe and sense of humor.,5,US,"July 27, 2023"
It was great service Gia and lisa were great.,5,US,"August 05, 2023"
"Quick service excellent staff!! Vehicle had a minor issue, roadside assistance requested to take the vehicle back to service center. Shift Manager Carlos & team Nassar and Anthony were very effective and helpful to issue a replacement vehicle without any delay. Checkout was super quick too. Only if room for error could be adjusted on the online booking as no refund allotted to the credit amount and was asked to utilize for future rentals. I do not live in the US, hence not sure when will return and the credit amount has only 1 year of validity. Other than that well recommended.",5,US,"July 25, 2023"
I had a very easy experience with no problems.,5,US,"July 28, 2023"
"Great price, but takes a while to get from the airport to the Fox rental car location.",4,IT,"August 01, 2023"
Overall positive experience. The only discordant note is the difficulty of getting in touch with customer service by phone,5,US,"July 25, 2023"
"The overall experience was great, the desk service was helpful and friendly with a smile at all time. The line was long but they expedited everyone very quickly. The return of the vehicle was also seamless and again quick and effortless. I have no complaints. Thank you very much.",5,US,"July 27, 2023"

Nice company,5,US,"August 01, 2023"
"We had the pleasure of renting a car from Fox. Staff was extremely nice. The car was okay, it got us where we needed to go and that's what we needed.  Knowing that Fox has older model vehicles didn't bother us at all The only disadvantage was the shuttle. It's a long walk through all the other car rentals to the shuttle. No phone # listed to call for pick up. Also they are not allowed to drop you off near the airport check-in.  Because of medical reasons we  chose to take a lyft from the rental office to the airport to as they could drop off at check in.",5,US,"August 01, 2023"
"Hello, My recent flight to Denver was not a good flight due to an abusive person on the flight which left me very upset all the way to the Fox building.  Our shuttle driver was absolutely wonderful.  Very attentive and helpful to my husband and I.  In fact he took some extra time helping my husband.  I went ahead and was assisted with the check in process by Faheed who immediately could see my state of mind was a bit fraught.  He immediately put me at ease and said many kind words through the check-in process.  I truly hope Fox pays him well as his customer service manner is golden.  When all was said and done my tears dried and I had a smile on my face.  Also, on our way out, your Gate Guard Alonzo was super helpful, nice and courteous.  Please send Faheed my best and hold on to him...he is a keeper.",5,US,"July 17, 2023"
FOX was just as efficient as industry leaders at lesser cost. I will look for FOX on future travel plans.,5,US,"July 20, 2023"
"Priced right, service was smooth and professional. Would definitely rent again!",5,US,"July 15, 2023"
"Price was good but you it’s not in the airport. It stays shuttle in the email confirmation but it’s confusing. The pick up drop of location is not marked “fox”. There was not an attendant outside guiding people. There is no organization when it comes to waiting for said shuttle, it’s a free for all in a smaller shuttle van vehicle. Sits about 10-12. If price is your biggest concern then try this place knowing it’s about 15-20 minute shuttle from airport. Trade off is price for inconvenience",3,US,"July 22, 2023"
"Very quick and friendly service. Great prices for nice, clean vehicles. I will never rent anywhere else.",5,N/A,"July 24, 2023"
The staff were super helpful + accommodating to us :),5,US,"July 20, 2023"
"All employees were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. We rented for a week and we’ll rent again from Fox on our next trip. Fox offered the best price in comparison with the other rental companies. Plus,  we had our choice of 2 cars.",5,AU,"July 21, 2023"
Nice car and great service.  Especially liked the prepaid tank refill - at a price that was better than the general price of gas on the street.,5,US,"July 31, 2023"
i had great experiences with staff and models of the car,5,US,"August 03, 2023"
"QUICK AND EASY TO RENT HERE,EVERYONE IS SUPER FRIENDLY.",5,US,"July 30, 2023"
"Ciara at the Seattle, WA counter made my day and because of her, I'll definitely use Fox again.  She was quick, polite, knowledgeable, and had a great sense of humor, which was refreshing after a long travel day.  The car was clean, and returning it was quick and easy.",5,NL,"July 24, 2023"
"Look at Tripadvisor and conclude below reviews are at least questionable. Fox is a scam, a steal. I would say criminal. They charge many renters double what they agreed by adding all sorts of insurance waivers. In my case they even falsified documents to have “proof” I signed up for these waivers.",1,US,"August 01, 2023"
"After our flight was delayed for four hours and being extremely tired, this rental car company was open at O'Hare at 5:00 a.m. where most were not open until 6:00 a.m.  It was refreshing to have a real person assist us in the car bay at pickup AND drop off.  We received our closing invoice upon return of the car, which again is refreshing given that other car rental companies do not have someone there to check customers back in and we've had issues about gas charges.  This was not the case with Fox.  Will rent again if pricing is competitive over other larger car rental companies.  Great service!!!",5,US,"July 27, 2023"
"Such a personalized experience! I wouldn't think that at a rental car place I would be addressed by name. Everyone from the shuttle driver to check in/pick up to drop off is always positive and its just such a pleasure to be greeted as such, especially after a long day of travel. The location is super convenient and I loved having my choice of car. I can't imagine using another rental company for future trips to LA.",5,US,"July 24, 2023"
Priority checkout was a smart choice with only 2 agents servicing a long line. I jumped straight to the front of the line. Quick checkout and quick return. No trouble with car. I had to change my trip plans due to a family illness that required returning early. I called Fox to adjust my reservation 2 weeks prior to the start of the trip. They told me they would charge me $20 for each day I returned the car early. So they got $80.00 from me and the ability to rent the car at the much higher last minute rate. A rip off.,3,US,"July 25, 2023"
"I had never heard of Fox but decided to give them a try since they were much cheaper than other car rental companies.  The shuttle was there when we arrived and it was a short ride to the Fox location.  The car wasn't ready immediately, but I only waited about 5 minutes until they brought it to me.  There was a little dirt in the back (probably didn't have time to get it fully cleaned) but overall the vehicle was great!  I had to drop it off shortly before 5 am and they already had shuttles heading to the airport.  I would recommend checking to make sure that tank is truly full when picking up the car (not sure if it was) but overall I am happy with the experience!",5,US,"July 24, 2023"
The guys that checked me out were very professional and nice. I loved my Hyundai Santa Fe. It was very clean and awesome to drive!,5,US,"July 27, 2023"

The paper was done and the car was waiting when I arrived. Very smooth.,4,US,"July 28, 2023"

Friendly and quick service picking up and dropping off the rental.,5,US,"July 27, 2023"

Unni was amazing at pickup. The original car I was supposed to recieve wasn't readily available so she got me fixed up with an alternative that exceeded my expectations!,5,US,"July 15, 2023"
We got a super gr8 car for 7 people. It was a super deal for the price.,4,US,"July 12, 2023"
The customer service was excellent! They answered all my questions and treated me with respect and attention. Other rental car companies try to burden you with many unnecessary services. I will definitely use Fox Rental Car for my next trip.,5,US,"July 27, 2023"
When I got there the line was not long. The guy at the counter got me in and out with out to long of a wait very professional. I got the car I wanted and the experience was satisfying.,5,US,"July 21, 2023"
Excellent experience; great car; easy process.,5,US,"July 25, 2023"
"Getting the car was a snap, two minutes. We rented a Chrysler Pacifica. It was in excellent condition and worked beautifully for our 22-day rental. Return took another two minutes. We've never had better value for the rates for a car-rental--and we've been traveling for 50 years.",5,US,"July 25, 2023"
"The staffs were so kind. They made our trip a pleasant start.However, the shuttle bus from the airport to the office came too late, so it was a little difficult.",5,US,"July 27, 2023"
"Great car, good price, friendly and helpful people.",5,US,"July 28, 2023"
We had to rent a car for my 19 year old daughter to drive after her car was in the repair shop. Russell at Fox Rental Austin made our rental experience quick and pleasant.,5,US,"July 23, 2023"
"Kady was excellent she deserves a raise and paid vacation. She made my experience wonderful, quick, kind, and courteous. She made the add-on seem like a perk and a natural flow of conversation. M’Chayla was also wonderful she made my return swift and easy she was courteous and kind. I’ll definitely return to Fox rental because of these two people.",5,US,"July 24, 2023"
Customer service was very nice. They did not add any hiden charges to the rental. The car was great and we will use Fox moving forward.,5,US,"July 20, 2023"
Nader and Josh provided warm welcomes. The car we received was excellent. Everyone enjoyed the ride. We look forward to coming back to Orlando.,5,US,"July 28, 2023"
The lost and found service was very good. More timely shuttle service or the ability to contact someone when delayed flights come in after midnight.,4,US,"July 30, 2023"
Their willingness to accommodate my request or closest to it.,5,US,"July 18, 2023"
"Everything starts with the check in, Greg was excellent in his professionalism with insightful information. It was the best experience that I had ever experienced with a rental.. Greg won me over with a beautiful Jeep and it was perfect for my outing. I will use Fox again…",5,US,"July 28, 2023"
The staff attitude was great. Really good pick up n drop off service.The car I got second time around was not the best in terms of performance but overall it got the job done.  : ),4,US,"July 29, 2023"
Great CSR experience.Good vehicles.Very good rental price.,5,US,"July 22, 2023"
"Requested vehicle class wasn't available upon my arrival, and I wasn't offered an upgrade to the next class. With today's technology, it shouldn't take that long at the counter",3,US,"July 26, 2023"
Every member we encountered with Fox went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied and happy with our rental and experience. I will definitely use this company in the future. Thank you for making our trip extra fun!  Great selection of cars!,5,N/A,"July 26, 2023"
Customer service was great and the pick and drop off smooth. I had to return the car a day early and the manager waived the early fee. I will use them again.,5,US,"July 29, 2023"
Everything about my experience at fox was top tier I recommend this company for you next rental they had a nice selection to choose from as well,5,GB,"July 23, 2023"
Although I’ve given them 5 stars my score would have been 4.5 if there was the option. Only because of the slight longer wait than usual for the Fox Shuttle bus to arrive to take us to the airport.There was a choice of cars for me to choose from in the class I had booked.The only snag was the receptionist still wanting me to buy more extras when I had already had the extras paid for upfront in my booking!Overall it was a pleasant experience with the car and company so will gladly use them again.,5,US,"July 26, 2023"
"Knowledgeable staff for checkout. No lines but that may change as becomes more popular and there does not appear to be a ""preferred"" like pickup situation. Received a fun car but I have not attempted to change cars vs the one provided. Getting in and out of the AUS airport rental car garage was as simple as all other agencies (mid-afternoon).",5,US,"July 20, 2023"
"Great price but desk personnel will use hard sell tactics to get you to purchase unnecessary and expensive add-ons like toll transponder rental and prepaid gas, etc..",3,US,"July 14, 2023"
"I have rented a few times from Fox Las Vegas.   Every time I have had a great experience.  I had several cars to choose from, they have been clean and reliable.   The staff have always been friendly and helpful to me.   The time spent at counter was super fast and I was out the door.  Checking in after was fast and easy.  Shuttle was reliable and the driver super helpful.",4,MX,"July 23, 2023"
"The people at check in were nice, but there weren't any cars available.  They did find me one, but it was an SUV instead of economy.  It just meant spending a bit more on gas. The young man who went over the car with me was quite helpful with the car and directions for getting out of the airport.  Someone just needs to be more organized about having cars available for the reservations made.",3,US,"July 12, 2023"
Long wait for the shuttle service but other that that very satisfied with Fox,4,US,"July 22, 2023"
Victoria or rental agent was great!!! Because of her I'll be back!,5,US,"July 29, 2023"
"I was pleasantly surprised by the overall experience at FOX near SLC airport.   This is my 3rd time renting from them and each time I have had nothing short of an excellent experience.  The staff have been very friendly and efficient, the check in process simple and the vehicles in great shape.  The main draw to them has been the pricing which is better than most in SLC, the staff and experience keep me coming back.",5,US,"July 19, 2023"
I’ve always rented from fox in Las Vegas Nevada and have never have a problem.. customer service is great..,5,US,"July 19, 2023"
Great staff. Energetic helpful.Fast friendly service,5,US,"July 24, 2023"
The ease of of the online experience and checking in was great!  I got my my car quickly and returning my car was even easier.  I got a quick shuttle to LAX.  First time renting with Fox but it will not be my last time.,5,US,"July 24, 2023"
Customer service was great. I was traveling with my son with special needs and the staff was more than willing to help us expedite our process.,5,US,"July 21, 2023"
"The agent that assisted me was so kind, courteous, knowledgeable and professional, and the supervisor resolved an issue that could have been devastating for me. Both made the rental experience comfortable and easy. The car was very clean and returning it was quick and easy, with assistance from the staff.",5,US,"July 26, 2023"
"Other than waiting for almost an hour, with only one person in front of me, because there was only one agent working,  my overall experience was great.  Will definitely rent again",5,US,"July 22, 2023"
"Very good attention, and easy processing",5,US,"July 20, 2023"
Very prompt service .. extremely clean vehicles…. Would choose them again and again !!,5,N/A,"July 25, 2023"
"Overall, I would have given this a 5 if we were not made to pay more at the counter. The transit from the airport is quick and easy and getting a vehicle and returning it is quick and easy. We arrived a few hours early due to a flight change and we were told that our car was not ready since we were so early. The choice was to either wait 2 hours or pay for an upgrade. This never happens with other companies especially in a large hub such as Las Vegas. The bottom line seems to be that they offer better prices but there is no flexibility in your booking.",4,US,"July 15, 2023"
Great Service!,5,US,"July 09, 2023"
Took a long time to checkin and obtain the vehicle ... charging $12/day for a second driver was poor,3,US,"July 16, 2023"
Great customer service. Process was very easy. Rental car extremely clean. Return process was awesome then the shuttle service takes  you directly to airport. All around awesome service.,5,US,"July 19, 2023"

"Fast, dependable servicea bit pushy with extras, but friendlygood new car and a great value",5,CA,"July 11, 2023"
"I was a bit weary of this location b/c of the previous reviews about long wait times, bad service, etc.  But it was a breeze for us.  Mind you, our pick-up was around 11am on a Thursday.  Waited about 10 mins in line before getting to a kiosk, and another 15 mins after that to do the paperwork.  It was very straightforward and the worker was courteous.  Our car was ready to go, and after the inspection report was done we were gone.  Return was a breeze as you just park it in the lot and hop on the shuttle.  My only issue with the car was that the driver's side vent was broken, so it was hard to angle the A/C correctly.  The car was clean inside and out.  Would rent from this location again.",4,CA,"July 20, 2023"
"I've always had good experiences renting from FOX in the U.S. however, renting out of Toronto was different.  They sent me a poorly written email the day before I was to pick up our full size SUV for a family of 7 and said they had overbooked and didn't have a vehicle for us. We were flying in from Calgary for the May long weekend.  It left us scrambling and we ended up paying $1,000 more for a short notice rental.  No response to emails requesting some rewards points or a discount for a future rental.DON'T RENT THROUGH FOX IN TORONTO",1,US,"May 18, 2023"
Great people at center. Good deal But the car was in horrible shape. Dirty inside. And outside was dented all over. Not small dents.big dents and huge black scrapes and bumper on right side barely hanging on. Looked like car had been in a few minor accidents.  Should not have been rented in that shape.,4,US,"July 19, 2023"
"The price was right.  There was a shortage of my preferred rental vehicle but I received a no charge upgrade. Carleena, the rental agent was helpful, efficient and pleasant!",5,US,"July 23, 2023"
"I chose Fox because they offered the best price for a recent rental out of Chicago O'Hare.  I will use them again because the staff was positive, helpful and friendly, and the car was clean and in good condition.  Pick up and drop off were easy.",5,US,"July 10, 2023"
The young lady who checked me in was very pleasant and wonderful!,5,US,"July 20, 2023"
Excellent and quick service with a good price,5,US,"July 21, 2023"
They made sure I received a car as close as possible to what I requested without up charging me. No pressures to add on anything…return was super easy and friendly.,5,US,"July 21, 2023"
They were very helpful to sort out a mistake that my husband made. Technically they didn’t need to and could have charged us a lot more. Pick up and drop off was super fast and the car was great.,5,US,"July 16, 2023"
Fox is the best rental company in the LA area. I enjoyed driving the rental car while I visited my family.,5,US,"July 19, 2023"
At first I was a bit nervous cuz I never heard of Fox. But they were nice and friendly and now I rather just go with Fox moving forward. Thank you.,5,N/A,"July 14, 2023"
"The entire crew at the Fox in Palm Beach Airport were so nice and professional. You can tell the manager takes great pride in how that location is run. I will definitely use Fox in the future for rentals based on this experience. I got a compact car and despite it being a rental with about 50k miles on it, it drove just as well as my SUV I have at home so you can tell they take good care of the cars, too.",5,US,"July 23, 2023"
"Here is our story with a very happy ending...Our rental van was returned 10:00pm on 7/23 and my Tour Manager's passport was found in the van the next day. A customer gave it to Ekram, and she went immediately to your Operational Manager, Maricel Rutland. Maricel went to the trouble of looking up the renter's name and contact information and called. Not only did she call personally to let me know rather than just sending an email, but when she found out that we needed it immediately for an upcoming Greece tour, she offered to take her lunch hour to go to the post office, overnight it and send the tracking # to us. That is service above and beyond and deserves acknowledgement!!These days it is so hard to find anyone that will go the extra mile. How refreshing!BIG thank you again to Maricel and Ekram!",5,US,"July 24, 2023"
"Great cars, fair pricing, excellent customer service",5,US,"July 21, 2023"
"Nothing felt difficult.  Aside from a bit of a long line when I arrived (which could not be helped), my experience was quick and pleasant.  I had reserved a car ahead of time so that part was quick, I was walked through the coverage options which were easy to understand and then I went to get my car.  Returning my car was even easier as I simply dropped it off and then received an email afterward.  I could not have asked for a simpler experience.  Everyone I encountered was pleasant as well.",5,BR,"July 21, 2023"
"I rented with Equinox and they gave me a Kona, a car well below the category. I booked for 300 dollars and they charged me 900. Draw your conclusions. They included tolls and excessive fees. I complained to them via email and they didn't respond. Do not rent on FOX!",1,US,"June 27, 2023"

"Simple pickup and return, the cheapest option in the Seattle airport for standard SUV, a good reliable car (Toyota Highlander)",5,US,"July 13, 2023"
"They’re the cheapest and you get what you pay for. The van I rented was idling pretty rough. The ‘change oil’ light came on about halfway through my trip maybe after about 3 or 4 hours worth of driving. I don’t know if I’d trust this company to provide a car that would make any kind of roadtrip, but if you want a cheap around town vehicle they’re probably fine. I’m sure I’ll rent here again. Just know with them that it’s not top tier.",3,US,"July 20, 2023"
"On July 15, 2023 we arrived to San Antonio,Texas Airport to pickup our reserved car through Expedia. We were told by David that our car was no longer available & that we could either upgrade at additional charge or we can go to another counter to reserve with another car rental. We contacted Expedia regarding the issue & Expedia says that it's showing that the car is available. Long story short, fox car rental was trying to get us to pay more money to upgrade. After being in the airport for 3 hours we got our reserved car without paying extra for anything. There were several other people at the airport with our same issue. Some lost their reservation because of this. Fox car rental is trying to rip people off by telling them their reservation is no longer available so that they can get you to pay more for an upgrade. I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT USE THIS CAR RENTAL AGAIN. THEY ARE A PIECE OF GARBAGE!",1,US,"July 15, 2023"
"It was quick and easy to get and return the car. We actually got to pick from a variety of choices.  Unfortunately, it wasn’t cleaned very well as it smelled of urine.",4,US,"July 18, 2023"
When my car needed to be exchanged - they got on right away as though nothing ever happened.,4,US,"July 14, 2023"
Everything with the pick up and drop off went smoothly but I am docking one star because some of the charges i received in the invoice did not match my actual charges. When I called to investigate the actual charges were on the up and up but they had to send me a revised invoice. I was on the verge of filing a dispute with my cc company. I highly recommend they do a better job of capturing charges correctly.,4,US,"July 18, 2023"

All was good.  Everything was handled nicely,5,US,"July 14, 2023"
The car for the price was a great value and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Pickup was an extremely easy process with no issues. Drop off was the best I have ever experienced with a car rental. Will definitely use Fox for all my future car rentals!,5,US,"July 20, 2023"
"FOX RENT A CAR IN TORONTO— a place to AVOID I was traveling from Boston to Toronto by Air Canada. Flight was delayed by 30 minutes. When I arrived in Toronto, I had to wait for 40 minutes for their shuttle to get to their counter.Their office was unclean & disorderly. I waited in line for my turn. By the time I got to the counter, I was asked about my reservation. I gave my driver’s license & credit card. I was immediately told “ Given you are late to pick up the vehicle, it was given away”. I was in shock !!!The 3 people at the counters were all looking like they were not used to how things are properly run in North America.I asked them - is there any chance to get another vehicle ?. The guy rudely screamed- “ No “ !!!. I was with my family & so I walked away. Then I had catch another shuttle & go back to Terminal 1 in Pearson & tent a car on the spot . They didn’t send me a text message or email notifying me what they did !!!It’s absolutely NOT worth any discounts FOX RENT A CAR gives in Toronto. Imagine I got there in the middle of the night or I was not able to rent a vehicle otherwise ?So now, you can decide for yourself !!!",1,US,"July 22, 2023"
"The staff!  They were friendly, helpful, and professional.",5,US,"July 18, 2023"
Excellent staff and service,5,US,"July 18, 2023"
"I booked flight and car rental together on Expedia.  After reserving, the airline changed the flight schedule and I wanted to adjust the pickup time.  Expedia said to contact Fox, but Fox staff were unable to make adjustments, citing Expedia holds.",3,US,"July 11, 2023"
It was quick and easy. Nice experience,5,US,"July 13, 2023"
"Exceptional service, quality and price out of DIA",5,US,"July 15, 2023"
The car I received was almost new. I didn't have any issues checking in or returning the car. The process was pretty quick. And I didn't wait long for the shuttle.,5,PR,"July 14, 2023"
"Definitely the people. I made two rentals as suggested by my insurance that only covers for 31 continuous days. First one managed by Nader, and the second one by Zohair; it was a pleasure experience with both of them. They are in good mood, they make sure you understand what are the options you offer and the benefit of them (tolls, gas, insurances, whatever you need to know) but none is pushy, they make you feel really comfortable with the transaction; that is the most important thing for us (but again, they make sure you understand what are the options and the benefit of taking them).I have been renting from Fox for years now, and it is because since sooooo loooong, that is mostly the same experience, feel comfortable with people at the counter. Please note that returning area people is also a pleasure to deal with (and please, don't forget the person at the gate, they do their part, and they do it well also). You see? the people is the key, you have wonderful people at MCO and at TPA were we had briefly rented from before). I almost forgot Customer Service and Billing personnel they are also great. Thanks for providing such a great experience. Success!",5,US,"July 15, 2023"
It was a great experience from agents and shuttle drivers having excellent customer service to the convenience and price.,5,US,"July 10, 2023"
Pick up and return was easy. Car was great and people are very nice.,5,US,"July 16, 2023"
"Best bargain. Easy pickup/return process. Decent selection of vehicles within the selected category. Long wait at the rental car terminal for the shuttle, but hassle free.",4,US,"July 12, 2023"
"The shuttle from the airport was a little slower than shuttles from other places and the check-in/pick-up process took far too long. However, when I finally checked in, I was given a brand new car, less than 1000 miles logged. The gal that checked me in was efficient, respectful and knowledgeable. The drop off experience was fast and super easy and only had to wait about 10 minutes for the shuttle to the airport. Shuttle drivers were friendly and helpful. Overall a good experience.",4,US,"July 11, 2023"
Some uncontrollable circumstances occurred but it did not affect the rental car. Employees were not the most friendly but I would rent from Fox again.,4,US,"July 15, 2023"
"We got a great car at a great price, and had an overall good experience. The only issue was that the shuttle ride to and from the airport is pretty long, and on the way back the driver stopped at the terminals out of order in order to let someone he seemed to know off earlier than the rest of us, which was not super cool.",4,US,"July 18, 2023"
First rental from Fox.  Recently I've found car rental lines very long and slow with only one person available to .check in or return with.  Fox was sufficiently staffed with helpful people.  At both the check in and check out the experience was the best I've had post Covid.,5,US,"July 04, 2023"
Very helpful staff members and ease of pick up and drop off. Also the the wait time was minimal and the vehicle was clean and ready to go.,5,US,"July 09, 2023"

Staff were very courteous and helpful. Vehicle was nice and clean so larger and more expensive than originally reserved.,5,US,"July 18, 2023"
"Best price around. Just like any other rental experience. Feared that I would have to wait but there was no line (granted it was a Wednesday). Seamless. I would caution others on being sold ""extras"" at the counter and to be aware of what you need and don't. You could be sold things that aren't needed. Car was a little more dinged than I thought. But for the price, and what we needed, this was perfect.",5,US,"July 12, 2023"
The rental counter personal was awesome and had great customer service skills,5,US,"July 16, 2023"
Customer service was friendly and fast.  No lines at all.  Car was a Camry.  Great AC for AZ in July,4,US,"July 06, 2023"
Customer interaction very professional.,5,US,"July 09, 2023"
Everything was great from the time we picked up the car to the time we returned it. Great people working there and very nice.

Retrain your desk people not to begin with being rude to paying customers no matter how upset they get when there is a problem at first or if it doesn’t go smoothly at first.,3,US,"July 12, 2023"
The pick up people were very nice. I just had to drop the car off in a line. There was some scratching on the front bumper when I picked it up so they did ask for my yellow damage slip at drop off. Luckily I kept track of it the whole trip or that may have been a hassle.,5,US,"July 12, 2023"

FOX rental made it easy for rent with good price for a last minute rental. Easy pick up and return.,4,US,"July 09, 2023"
"My rental was a very sweet suv ride that didnt break down, got me from A to B and allowed me to spend precious time with my family . I used American Airlines points to book my rental for 11 days. Also paid for the Florida toll pass just incase....that cost me 150 bucks...yikes. I only drove on a toll road twice which was under 10 bucks. Took the L on that but if you dont buy the pass, each plate scan is 20 bucks.",5,MX,"July 04, 2023"
It was so comfortable to notice you are always ready to help and support,5,US,"July 15, 2023"
Start to finish everything was quick and efficient,5,US,"July 12, 2023"
"Great team , great car , great deal",5,US,"July 05, 2023"
Only issue I had was upon return. I was under the impression I had agreed to the pre paid fuel price at a low rate but upon return they stated my contract didn’t not have that on it. So instead of the $3.64 a gallon I was charged $8+ a gallon. Made my rental a tremendous amount more than expected.,3,CA,"July 15, 2023"
"First time Fox Rental customer, I was not sure what to expect but decided to give it a try as the rates were significantly better than the national companies.  Arrived on a Saturday morning, staff was great and we were in and out in less than 10 minutes.  Similar experience when we returned the rental.  Definitely recommend giving Fox a try",5,US,"July 08, 2023"
The counter manager was so so helpful. She handle the situation and made sure we received a car.,5,US,"June 07, 2023"
She gave me the best deal on the best vehicle that I could get.,5,US,"July 08, 2023"
Good price. Easy to pick and drop off,4,US,"July 11, 2023"
computer system is slow… per your front desk staff.,4,US,"July 12, 2023"
Fox Rent-a-car is a criminal organization that defrauds its customers through double billing and unnecessary add-ons to the final bill; and they do not keep their word to reverse charges. Fake insurance set ups and special arrangements. Run away fast,1,US,"July 18, 2023"
Loved that they gave us a brand new dodge Durango. We originally chose a Camry but the lady at the front desk probably knew we needed something bigger since we had the 2 kids to haul with us. Loved all the specs of the car and also both the lady and guy who helped us was both so very nice. I appreciate their hospitality,5,US,"July 04, 2023"
"The staff was professional, efficient, kind, and easy to work with.  The vehicle was fantastic and the process of selecting and returning was easy.  Thank you!",5,US,"July 08, 2023"
"Highly recommend this company, we had a great experience, definitely using them again!",5,N/A,"July 10, 2023"
"Easy to book,  best price around!!  Can wasn't ready but they offered a minivan which turned out perfect. Would definitely rent from Fox again.",5,US,"June 29, 2023"
"Please look at the contract before you sign. They won’t tell you when they add additional insurances without your consent, I ended up paying double because the representative added a whole bunch of extras without asking me.",1,PR,"July 02, 2023"
From the car rental pick up to the drop off of the vehicle there was nothing to add to make it better.all in all an perfect car rental experience.,5,US,"July 09, 2023"
"We reserved in Cabo from Priceline and purchased the insurance. When we arrived at the AP Fox rental we got the, “Your reservation is no good!” They did an end run on the car costing me $470 for a 2 hamster heap! I called 2 times and wrote to Fox 2 times, no response! Don’t fall prey to these thieves!",1,CH,"April 08, 2023"
"No lines, no waiting. Tamika at drop off was so friendly and helpful. She directed us very clearly to where I needed to be. The people at the desk for my reservation were quick and efficient. Took minutes!",5,US,"July 14, 2023"
Super quick and easy. There was no line so it went by quick. Rental was in great condition and clean. Staff was very friendly!,5,US,"July 10, 2023"
"Your staff is great, especially Nader who is professional and friendly. your cars are clean, prices are great! I like the location, easy in and out without dealing with airport hassles. no hidden charges, keep up the good work guys, I will never rent from other companies as long as Fox is here in Orlando.",5,US,"July 02, 2023"
May not need tolls - probably depends upon travel days,4,US,"July 13, 2023"
Other than a long wait to get the car. The process went easy once I got to get counter.,5,US,"July 11, 2023"
"Greated with a smile, receptionist was very helpful, the ease in picking up my vehicle was awesome, and the return was so easy and quick,the dodge I picked up was very clean, worked great,drove smoothly I've rented from countless places and never had a great experence from start to finish, I was over due but never thought this would be it I cant say enough if you want Your reservation to be great, your car to be ready. When you're there, the staff to be very enjoyable. And seem like they are just happy to be there as well as very happy to help you, this is the place.For you, because just picking up and dropping off. The vehicle was so easy.  I'm just in awe at how easy and peaceful it was for me to do that. The shuttle was available, and when I came in it was'nt right there, however when I was leaving to get into my rental car, the shuttle came so the wait was no more than 5 to 10 minutes.  I didn't have to take the shuttle, but it seemed nice. It was large, it fitted a lot of people. Everyone seemed to be happy on their vacation. Taking the shuttle back to wherever they were going.  If I have to, I'm gonna try to shuttle just to see how it is. But all in all great experience, first time ever from start to finish. This is the place Fox car rentals.",5,US,"July 09, 2023"
Ease of booking and pickup! Staff were friendly! Thanks,5,US,"July 09, 2023"
"I had to change a rented car with new one, becausethe first car's brake and handle didn't work properly.I think more careful inspection is needed.",3,US,"July 06, 2023"
"Having read some critical reviews of the Fort Myers office, I was concerned. But I arrived, got checked out quickly and the shuttle was ready to take me to the terminal immediately. What's not to like?",5,US,"July 07, 2023"
"I don't know... Give me a free low mpg SUV rental (i.e., Mazda CX-5 or Toyota RAV4). The member of staff who served me at pick-up wasn't very patient with me, as I was trying to pull my ID from my wallet, notwithstanding the fact that there was not a line of people behind me. Once I gave her my ID, she shouted my name out. I don't like that. I didn't appreciate that. I don't think that anyone likes that... Privacy is important, especially for me. She became personable when I asked the question about securing a rental car at a lower rate. However, when we walked out to see the ""Manager's Special"" she said that it would be a full-size to mid-size SUV, but she forced me an almost 6'6"" guy to select one of the three Chargers. Charger sits very low and have poor visibility. When I tried to explain that to her, she didn't do anything to help me. She played the negotiation game of ""silence and repeat the previous position or option"". Those experiences don't sit well with me, because it could lead to the spirit of argumentation and confrontation per the disagreement and ultimately rancor. So, the ease of my overall pick-up experience was not so good, it was only good because there was not anyone in line when I walked in. If there was a line or longer, my experience could have been worst as the personalities behind the desk could probably become overwhelmed by the impatience of people waiting in a long line. As stated, I was NOT satisfied with the vehicle I was forced to accept, but I was absolutely satisfied the overall cleanliness of the vehicle. However, there were a number of dents. My experience when returning the vehicle was simple and quick, but I didn't receive a receipt to prove that everything was okay like the audit at the exit was conducted before I left the property with the vehicle. I took the city bus from my hotel to Fox. My experience taking the shuttle bus from Fox to the airport was cool.  The guy was amicable and aired smooth jazz. Thus, if you would like to improve to make my experience a 10, which will convince me to recommend Fox others in my network, then simply give me a free 2-day low mpg SUV rental (i.e., Mazda CX-5 or Toyota RAV4). That would take the bitterness out.",3,US,"July 11, 2023"
"Great car, nice people, good price, no surprises. I opted for returning with a half full tank and it was much easier than other options.",4,US,"July 04, 2023"
"Noel was wonderful! Sweet, informative and accommodating.",5,US,"July 06, 2023"
"Good service, great clean car, easy drop off.",5,US,"July 10, 2023"
"I am extremely disappointed with my experience reserving a car rental through Fox. Despite booking in advance through Expedia, the individual at the front desk, Mehdi, not only provided misleading information but also falsely claimed that we were legally required to purchase rental liability insurance in Florida. This unnecessary upselling tactic is completely unacceptable.Furthermore, when we inquired about the plate toll pass and explained our travel plans, Mehdi strongly recommended it, even though we ended up needing it only once. This proves that their recommendations are solely focused on maximizing their profits, rather than providing valuable and honest advice to customers.To make matters worse, upon returning the vehicle, Anthony, the person responsible for inspecting the gas level, assured us that he would mark it as half a tank if we gave a positive review. However, it is evident that he lied, as our final charges indicated that the tank was still recorded as a quarter full. This deceitful behavior is utterly reprehensible.As a result of these deceptive practices, we were forced to pay significantly more than the initial booking through Expedia. I strongly caution others against using this car rental company. Their staff members are untrustworthy, pushy with upselling, and ultimately only interested in wasting customers' hard-earned money.",1,US,"July 01, 2023"
"Mr Thomas is very nice and polite, explained everything clearly and easy to understand.Thank you very much.",5,N/A,"July 05, 2023"
"Pick-up process was not well explained and there were a lot of ""extra"" fees when picking up the vehicle. Charged $175 to rent 2 $20 booster seats.",3,US,"July 07, 2023"
I disliked the wait time to receive the vehicle. And also returning the vehicle you don’t receive a copy of the statement right away. If you pre pay they still have other fees that they charge on top of what you already paid,3,US,"July 05, 2023"
"I rented a Ford Expedition with great condition!The staff are polite and responsive. Easy pick up at SFO and easy drop of at LAX, good shuttle services.",5,CA,"July 03, 2023"
They could’ve put more employees at the front desk to make the pick up faster. We waited for more than 30 mins. to get our vehicle. I paid for a Grand Cherokee or similar vehicle but instead got a Rav 4 (which is not bad) although I would’ve like the Cherokee better. Overall it was an OK experience renting at Fox. Would rent again for sure.,3,US,"June 25, 2023"
"Ricardo in Denver is awesome!! He is what we would model customer service after. The line was long and people were upset but Ricardo greeted everyone with a smile and provided to notch customer service.With our Ricardo, this would be a very different review. He made the experience much better overall.",5,US,"July 09, 2023"
Don’t believe the horrible reviews amazing customer service and a great deal had a brand new car for around $200 for the week forgot something in the car palm return it was back in my possession within two days,5,US,"July 04, 2023"
"Pickup at the airport was a little slow, but once at the rental center all went smoothly.  Service was friendly.  Staff was courteous.  Ford Fusion provided 38-40 MPG over 11 days.  Flawless performance by the rental car.",5,US,"June 30, 2023"
"I was very nervous about the drop off procedure being at the airport. But, once arriving to the area, you just follow the signs. So nice!",5,US,"July 11, 2023"
"I was pleased with my rental. The airport pickup was fast and easy, rental car pickup was slow but the staff was very pleasant and courteous. My rental car was clean and drop-off was easy. I would be renting from them again.",4,TC,"July 08, 2023"
"Car, process and free van to and from was great . The lady at return is rude .",5,US,"July 07, 2023"
"For the most part. I have always had a good experience when renting the cars. So far everyone to whom I have been in contact with have always been well informed and down to earth. Make a stressful situation, stressless.",5,US,"June 20, 2023"
"I didn’t realize that it was farther away from the main car rental location, but it was worth it. I received great customer service and all was good.",5,US,"July 07, 2023"
"Worst experience ever!Old cars, dirty, and staff that is trying to sell you express tolls ($12/day) where the tolls are voided and unnecessary. Be aware and rent from somewhere else. I will never ever rent from them!I rented from Denver, first I got a car full of animal fur. Second car had the tires very used, and finally the third car was a 3 years old car with almost 60,000 miles.The guy at the front desk was asking first if I it’s my first time in Colorado, to see if he can full me with the Expres toll pass (12x8days). Well when I was driving around I figure out that all tolls were void. You don’t need that. It’s just a way for him to make money. Not honest!",1,AU,"June 30, 2023"
"Seamless, friendly, no fuss, trusted them and they were excited for us, with giving us a convertible for our stay in MiamiI’d never heard of Fox but I’d use them again. Found them through first time Uber rental. Loved the experience",5,US,"July 10, 2023"
Very nice staff and the car ran beautifully. But we purchased gas from the company and  were told we would get the money back for the gas we did not use when we returned the car. We purchased a half tank of gas and used only a quarter of a tank but were told when we returned the car that we would not get the money back for the gas we did not use. That is something that they need to get clear and be honest about when you purchase the gas.,4,US,"July 08, 2023"
Fox = Greatness You would make a mistake if you DONT use Fox - the have set the benchmark for excellence- well done to the team in Vegas and Los Angeles- you guys are the best 👍👍😀😀,5,US,"July 03, 2023"

"We had a reservation for a mid-size SUV in Seattle. Once we got the through the reservation desk we had to wait for over an hour for this vehicle. Apparently the check in desk was giving out vehicles that were not ready. The keys desk has been running around for an hour because of poor operations. We had a tight deadline to make a ferry. There was a major disconnect between the the people at the reservation desk and the key desk, plenty of people have came and went with no issues. What happened was the person who messed up the reservation got locked out of the system. So tried to reach out to the manager to hear if they would compensate or extend our return time but heard nothing back despite multiple attempts. I will never rent from this company again.",1,US,"July 06, 2023"
"The experience with the car and employees was great , especially the manager Moises , grateful for the service .",5,US,"July 09, 2023"
"Overall experience at fox was good, the car was not cleaned when picked up but overall was a nice vehicle.  The Fox site was not at the main car rental site in Las Vegas so had to take 2 shuttles to get to the Fox site.  My suggestion would be to have a shuttle pick up directly from the airport to their site as it was harder for the “older group” to manage luggage/time.",4,US,"June 26, 2023"
"The car we got was clean and spacious but was not a very comfortable ride and seemed cheap (doors closed with a tinny sound, tires were very loud on road).",3,US,"June 28, 2023"

Second time I am renting from Fox one in Salt Lake City this past year and recently at PBI.  Both times the staff was exceptional courteous and friendly. There was no negativity about anybody who worked for Fox very positive attitudes all around. The person at the gate at PBI goes by the letter E. He was exceptionally pleasant and the car was in top condition. I will definitely run from them again.,5,CA,"July 11, 2023"
FOX was fast & affordable. I would definitely rent a vehicle there again,5,US,"July 02, 2023"
Positivity all around both personally and observed with other client interactions.,5,US,"July 08, 2023"
"Staff is great. The vehicle I was given had some cosmetic issues and body damage.  Not sure why a rental company would rent damaged vehicles.  Also, had issue with one one the seat belts in the back seat, and was unable to take the rental to the beach due to this issue.  I will rent again from Fox because of the staff, but I’ll make sure everything is properly working.",4,US,"June 29, 2023"
Good customer services is a must and Fox has done an excellent job,4,US,"June 28, 2023"

We requested one truck and they give us small car with the same price. And The car that they give to us smells like cigarettes terrible.,2,US,"July 04, 2023"
"Good experience if not for one thing: in the the rear door cup holder there was a paper cup full of some goo — oatmeal or cornflakes. We did not see it when we picked the car up, so it was discovered by my passenger a few days later. It was super gross by then. At the pick up I did notice an empty cup with dried out coffee in the back pocket of a  front seat. That cup I gave to an attendant for disposal. So, Fox, a bit more attention to detail, perhaps 🤔?",4,US,"July 03, 2023"
Very professional easy shuttle from and to LAX,5,US,"June 29, 2023"
This was our first experience with Fox rental and I was very pleased with everything. Our car was fantastic and clean. The service at the counter was easy and the attendant was so kind. The main reason we rented was the great pricing for cars but we got so much more. We will definitely use Fox in the future.,5,US,"July 03, 2023"

"Hello everyone, do not be fooled, I supposedly had to pay this amount $579.27, the $738.39 is with the deposit when you pick it up. They are top-notch scammers, they know that many tourists come to the Florida area, the regulations for those companies should be stronger. I call your customer service that is located on another continent and they do not speak much English by the way. The second representative I contacted was better, but they are trained to be closed-minded based on the agreement, only based on whether you read the agreement before renting.",1,US,"July 08, 2023"
"It was our first-time visiting Phoenix. Our arrival from the airport to the car rental offices was seamless.  The Fox workers are very courteous, prompt and efficient. The car assigned to us was very well-maintained and clean.",5,US,"June 30, 2023"

The team at the desk and returns had great people skills..,5,US,"July 01, 2023"
The customer service is excellent. The vehicle was ready upon arrival and the process was very fast which allowed me to start my vacation quick. I had an issue with double booking and the Fox team was very helpful. Returning the vehicle was easy and quick. I’ve used other companies before and I think this one has been the quickest during a busy time at the airport.,5,US,"June 23, 2023"

They were friendly and very efficient. Everything was taken care of prior to picking vehicle up. The vehicle was clean and ready to go. Very little wait time for pickup and drop off.,5,US,"July 02, 2023"
I reserved the car months ahead and was worried that my reservations would be canceled or forgotten or there wouldn’t be a car available since I had such a late arrival. All my worries were just that - worries. The shuttle pickup through the reservation process and return was trouble free and at the lowest cost of any rental I could find. Thanks Fox for the great experience,5,US,"June 26, 2023"
The price and available vehicles choices were great.  The staff were so friendly as well as professional.  They answered everything and provided guidance without acting annoyed about my questions.  Customer service is a major key in satisfactory reviews.,5,US,"July 07, 2023"

"Did not like the long wait to pick up car with only one employee available for quite a long time. Drop off was a breeze. Car had a spoiled milk smell coming from vents.  Car was clean, comfortable and spacious. Would have preferred to get the car and drop it off at the airport or closer to it.",3,US,"June 24, 2023"
Treating their customers as clients!!! Thanking me for continuing to rent from Fox...So Important because I have choices and the rental agent I had take care of me was great!!,5,US,"June 21, 2023"
Fox has great rates for anyone. And the deposit isn't big. The cars are pretty clean and newer. I've rented in Seattle and LA from Fox. The shuttles from the airports are very convenient with staff that help you load your luggage on and off the bus. Staff at each location were great. Very knowledgeable and friendly. Did their best to upsell and let me know about benefits. Such as prepaid fuel that was cheaper than gas stations around the airport.,5,US,"June 26, 2023"
"Horrible car rental company.  We rented a car through the Capital One travel portal for $500, when we picked the car up there was an additional $500 charge.  WTH?I have rented cars for many years in all countries.  This rental service has NO service after 10pm or before 8am!  So because of flight delays we had to get a taxi to the hotel in a different town, then back again the next day.  We called them before they closed telling them of the flight delay, but all they could say is ""too bad, we close at 10pm on the dot"".Likewise our flight out was before 8am but there was no drop off before 8a so we missed our flight.  Fox does not understand how travel works.",1,IN,"July 09, 2023"
we did not have a prebooking and the counter lady said they only had SUVs while we wanted a cheaper option. we visited Expedia and got a cheaper car coincidentally from Fox again. This time when we went back to the lady at the counter - we had a bad attitude experience and had to keep our cool including when my knowledge as an insurance professional was subtly questioned. Finally the car alloted by the lady was a beat up old sedan with scratches and paint chipping in places and no display for Google Maps. Other than this lady - everything else was as it should be - smooth.,2,GB,"July 01, 2023"
"Pick up and return too and from the off site office was good but as I arrived in C terminal I had to make a journey to B terminal were the shuttle picked up from.Staff were good and the wait time was short but staff we’re trying to sell extras that I didn’t require.Toll use was not explained fully I was informed that you could not pay by cash or over the internet so paid for the plate pass for the whole rental period, I did not need this as you can pay by cash and over the internet for the two days that I went on a Toll road ( to and from the airport).Although the rental price was good the extras made it comparable to other leading brands so will look at these next time.",4,US,"June 29, 2023"
Experience with great. Staff member Sky was excellent and dropping off was so easy.,5,N/A,"June 29, 2023"
"We chose a ""grab bag"" SUV for cost efficiency. We received the new Nissan Rogue. It was beautiful and fancy smansy. It was so new, though, that I didn't know how to put it in reverse, and no one warned us ahead of time.However, the vehicle was so great that it still gets high marks! I felt safe and far more comfortable driving on the San Antonio highways with it.",4,CA,"July 03, 2023"
The staff are very helpful… both pick up and drop off went smoothly.  Thanks,5,US,"June 29, 2023"
Due to a delayed flight I arrived to the rental center very late and the company I was supposed to pick up my rental car from was already closed. Fox rental was the only agency open and they were able to help me and my family out by providing us with a vehicle. I am so extremely thankful for their help and service. The people were so nice and respectful. Would definitely recommend to anyone.,5,US,"June 28, 2023"

"Horrible customer service. Booked through Expedia. Paid for insurance. Car I reserved wasn't available so they upgraded but charged me for it. Also charge for tons of extras they snuck in. Brought it back full of gas was charged for a tank of gas. 238$ turned into over 700$. Once I returned the car waited for the shuttle for over 45 minutes. Ended up missing my flight. Had to buy a new ticket. When I called about all the extra charges. I was told there is no way to know what the guy at the counter told me or didn't tell me so they just have to take his word for going over these extra charges. Totally bad. If I could give them negative stars I would. Don't use fox in Dallas fort worth, TX airport.",1,US,"July 07, 2023"
Upgraded to a nicer vehicle.  Counters were slammed with customers so recommend more customer service agents.  Return process was exceedingly easy as we were the first ones there (0500).,5,US,"June 25, 2023"

"The experience over all was good. The jeep was awesome, however it was very dirty both inside and out. Dust is okay in Vegas, but mud inside and out is not. Don't prepay for gas, get your gas outside. The get to Fox is a double shuttle, so make arrangements for extra time to the airport upon returning the car.",4,MX,"June 26, 2023"
"My only complaint was that the desk in the terminal was unmanned at 11:30 p.m., with a sign saying open until midnight.  After a long day of travelling, it was a bit disheartening.  The ladies working in the garage were happy and helpful, so it was all great in the end.  I would love to be able to handle the ""paperwork"" on line ahead of time, in order to speed up the process of picking up the car.",4,US,"July 03, 2023"
"Great Rental Experience!  I was skeptical because of all of the negative reviews I had seen, but our experience was great.  Shuttle was on-time & driver friendly and helpful.

No funny business. Courteous and professional and the checkout process is the easiest ever!Literally just dropped off the car and left and didn't have to do anymore paperwork! What a delightful breeze!,5,US,"June 24, 2023"
Was lied to at the counter. Was signed up for coverage when I refused several times. Had to wait 20 extra mins because the lady at the desk said there was a hold on PA licenses which there wasn't. Made us show a bill even though we had a major CC. The manager decided to fight with me instead of just refund the small disputed amount. She was extremely rude and had 0 empathy for anyone. Manager admitted her employees don't follow the rules but just kept saying I signed for stuff I didn't agree too. Don't ever rent from them please I beg you avoid at all cost. I use to work for Enterprise and even though they weren't perfect never ever would have treated anyone like they treated me and my husband. Terrible place. Probably worst customer service I've ever received.,1,US,"June 09, 2023"

"It’s a little inconvenient that the rental site is not at the airport and we had to wait 15 minutes or so in the hot sun for the shuttle.

I will definitely rent from Fox again in the future.",4,US,"June 26, 2023"

Rented car in March for Seattle trip in August.  Had to cancel at beginning of July due to family issues.  Rental rate included cancellation for any reason charge.  Had to call multiple times to get refund.  The refund was only 75% of rental charge.  Beware! What a ripoff,1,US,"July 05, 2023"

Fox staff made our experience easy and joyful!!,5,US,"June 18, 2023"
"I'm not sure if I just came at the right time or just have great luck, but this was the smoothest, best car rental experience I've ever had. I paid for everything in advance online directly though Fox. I never use third party bookings anymore so I recommend going through Fox directly rather than third party like booking.com. I didn't wait in line at all when arriving at the airport, which was maybe just good timing. The woman working with us was very polite and understanding. She did offer me a lot of extra stuff, but I just politely declined and she didn't push it which was a HUGE relief compared to other companies. That alone makes me want to ONLY rent from FOX. We were all set and on the highway within less than 30 minutes total. We returned during closed hours and just followed the instructions we were given. Parked the car in designated area. Put keys in the Dropbox. I received a receipt later that day for the exact amount I was told. I rented a Nissan sudan. It was the exact one in the photo online, but I'm also not bothered by that as long as it's similar. Good gas mileage. Super smooth ride. Fairly new. Highly recommend. Will def be renting from FOX in the future!",5,US,"June 23, 2023"

The ease of the overall rental car experience,5,US,"June 21, 2023"
"This is the only 1-star review I have ever written. Trash rental car company. It’s fairly clear they exist to make a quick buck off of unsuspecting travelers. The worst cars, fees, and customer service out of any rental company I’ve used.  They will charge you obscene $15 administrative fees on each toll booth. Toll booths are for the road maintenance, not for Fox rental cars to rake people over the coals. They might have the lowest initial rates, but $100 later in hidden taxes and fees and a 2 hour wait in line for a car and I will never rent from this company again.",1,US,"June 07, 2023"

"we came to fox and had a quick, hassle-free and smooth experience with your rep… this was in contrast to having a terrible experience at ace rent a car (never rent from them because of their unethical bait and switch tactics /hidden fees- read about all the complaints online for ace).  for that reason, renting from fox in los angeles was a relief.  the rep did not try and trick us into paying for what we did not need (extra coverage) and all the staff at los angeles were so friendly and helpful.  the seating area was large and they provided water and some small snacks.  the vehicle was very clean and new. returning the car was quick and the shuttle to the airport was not a long wait due to the early hour. we would rent from fox again.  (warning to avoid ace rent a car- they will cheat you and you will have no way to get your money back).",5,US,"June 24, 2023"
"The service at the reception to pick up the vehicle was bad, the service was only concerned with selling services, how could you not buy what it was offering? The service that started out good became pessimistic, the attendant was very rude… return was very good.",4,US,"June 22, 2023"
My for reservation was held 2 weeks without any money and was honored at the locked in price the shuttle driver was friendly and fast the counter had one person it was 9am but she was fast and gave me an upgrade to full size for free as they were out of mid size ...overall a smooth easy experience and a quick return ... competetive pricing,4,US,"June 20, 2023"

"Although my flight was delayed for almost an hour, I had no trouble getting a rental and being on my way. No problems in San Antonio but it was the exact opposite for my experience in Austin but I believe it had to do with the individual that was helping/not helping me.",4,US,"June 22, 2023"
Fox Rent-A-Car did a great job providing me with a 2023 Toyota Corolla for a great price. The car was clean and ready to go upon arrival. I will use this company again.,5,US,"June 27, 2023"
The car I reserved was not available on the day of my arrival.  I was upsold to a different vehicle.,3,US,"June 20, 2023"
"Always clean cars, easy and convenient drop-off. Best rates in town!!!!!!",5,US,"June 20, 2023"
Wiper blades needed replaced and of course it rained the night we picked up the  car. Windshield and surrounding windows needed cleaned inside. Front and back were the worst. Had to stop and wipe them down so we could see in the rain.Other than that the car was great. Also got great gas milage. Moon roof was nice while driving at night. The staff was polite courteous from start to finish.,4,US,"June 24, 2023"
"Fox Rent-A-Car at the San Antonio airport attempted to charge me an additional $148.27 (about 25.44% of the total price of the rental) for a “mandatory loss of use” fee at the time I was picking up the vehicle. I said 1) there has been no loss of use as I obviously haven’t been in an accident yet with their vehicle and 2) the credit card I used to book the rental car with, underneath its “Guide to Benefits“ document states, ""The Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver covers theft, damage, ***valid loss-of-use charges imposed and substantiated by the auto rental company***…”. Hence, I did not need to pay their fee. The representative reiterated that it was a mandatory fee and that she would not drop this bogus, unnecessary and undisclosed fee. I spoke with a manager named Clarissa and she falsely stated that no insurance company or credit card covers “loss of use” and this is why they are charging the fee. I said that this is incorrect and to prevent additional arguing, she agreed to waive the fee. Just avoid this company like the plague and if you book through a third party site, notify them that this company is charging unnecessary fees for those who already have coverage for things like ""loss of use."" I might also recommend contacting the state of Texas and FTC/CFPB because if they get enough complaints, they may open up an investigation.",1,US,"June 15, 2023"
Diana the lady at the counter at Oakland Intl Airport and the man at the return were excellent.,5,US,"June 25, 2023"

Never will work with them again and will tell everyone and their mother about them.",1,US,"June 29, 2023"
"Car was great, personnel were good, waits and shuttles were very difficult and trying.  Company needs more personnel.",4,US,"June 26, 2023"
I was upgraded to a nice SUV for the day I rented a vehicle to allow us to explore between hotel check out and late evening flight. The lot staff in Phoenix were extremely helpful and cheerful. Picking up the car was extremely fast and return was effortless and extraordinarily quick (which we really needed).,5,US,"June 26, 2023"
Great experience. A little pricey But worth it in the end. Also they could use a few more customer service agents in person. Otherwise a good experience!,5,US,"June 26, 2023"

The agent was professional and courteous.,5,US,"June 15, 2023"
"Excellent shuttle service, polite and helpful staff, less than 10 mins of processing time.. same experience on return.

"The car and service were excellent but I was upsold on a lot of items I did not need.  Prepaid ""return empty"" fuel was highest of any prices we saw.  I was also encouraged to pre-pay tolls with ""threat"" of paying high penalty if I didn't.  We paid far more than we used and tolls were easily avoidable.  We paid almost 2x's the expected cost of the rental.",3,US,"June 19, 2023"
Very budget friendly and nice staff. I do recommend taking an uber to and from airport as the shuttle they provided was not running every 10 minutes like they claimed. Save yourself the frustration and bypass that part of it if you can afford the $15.,4,US,"June 12, 2023"
The staff at drop off were stellar. They really went out of their way to retrieve an item I left behind.,4,US,"June 25, 2023"

"1. We should have been told up front at time of booking about the tolls in Florida.  We could have brought our NY EZPASS instead of paying the $14/day charge for tolls.2. At the time of booking I booked under my name.  We wanted to switch to my husband as the driver, still staying as one driver.  He's a better driver and I hate driving.  We were told we could ADD John at an additional charge but could not switch drivers.   Come on - what's the difference as long as it's still one driver.3.  At drop off I asked for a printed copy of the receipt.  The agent, who was sitting next to a printer refused to print me a copy and said I could view it online.  After several requests I gave up!",3,US,"June 21, 2023"

"Counter person was extremely knowledgeable, Professional and willing to be helpful",5,N/A,"June 14, 2023"
The shuttle bus at the airport took over 30 mins for them to come and pick us up. One person waiting decided to take an uber because they were tired of waiting. When the driver arrived they were not careful with my golf clubs and they almost snaped the clubs when they put them in the shuttle. The person at the desk kept adding additional costs to my ticket without asking me if I wanted the additional services. I had already purchased insurance through the Expedia reservation but he kept trying to add more insureance to my reservation. He kept saying that he was upgrading me but the vehical I received was the exact one I had reserved. Not sure how it was an upgrade. I think he just kept saying that to try and make me feel good.,2,US,"June 17, 2023"
It was easy in and easy out for a  week worth of parking.  I thought I did  not lock my car.... I called and they pleasantly checked for me and relieved my concerns.  Very satisfied!,5,US,"June 13, 2023"

"Getting the car took over 2 hours in line, only one person working, he did a good job and kept a good attitude about the situation. But fox needs to hire more employees when you get off a plane you shouldn’t have to spend another 2 hours getting a car.",3,US,"May 30, 2023"
"The entire Fox Car Rental staff at Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) Airport is absolutely amazing. Their professionalism, courtesy, and customer service are truly FIRST CLASS!

"Car was fine, clean and ran well. Even got a gas credit on return.Pick up shuttle, excessive wait. Watched multiple shuttles of other companies come and go. Driver not very helpful for families struggling with bags.Return of car confusing. Waited in line 10-15 for a worker to show up check car out. Be sure to arrive early.Shuttle driver to airport backed up van and stopped to talk to another driver. Then dropped us off at wrong terminal for Delta. Signs on doors and clearly no one inside. They moved terminals which I feel FOX should have been aware of. Luckily we traveled light so walking to different terminal wasn’t too bad. Not good for people with check bags",3,US,"June 12, 2023"

Fox is a great option for a lower cost rental car company. I would give them 5 stars but their process to get a car once arriving at the counter is so backward and adds time and stress to the travel process which none of us need.,3,US,"June 15, 2023"

Straight forward pricing with out all the added BS you get from others. Hertz and Budget always trying to nickel and dime and add fees. I rented a 7 passenger SUV for $250 less than what my son paid at budget for a minivan with bald tires and constant dash lights. FOX FOX FOX!!!!,5,PR,"June 07, 2023"
Everything's was good,5,US,"June 18, 2023"
"We have been Fox renters for years and overall, we have been very satisfied. There is only one complaint, the price at checkout does not match the original quote. Unforeseen taxes, surcharges and unknowns such as VLF, 7 VLF, 7ERF and ERF should be included in the original proposal. There was a $77.62 difference between the initial and checkout for a 7-day rental. Fox should include these charges before quoting a lease.",5,US,"June 17, 2023"
Ricardo did a great job making sure we were taken care of.  Our flight was delayed and we couldn’t pick up the car on time.  He made sure we had a vehicle and we were taken care of.  Thank you!,5,CA,"June 08, 2023"
"I booked through Expedia and it said my booking was with Europcar and I could pick up my rental at SFO airport. When got to the rental car pick-up area at SFO I didn't see Europcar. I rechecked my pick-up instructions email from Expedia to make sure I wasn't missing something. That email had no mention of Europcar owning Fox.  I had to call Expedia to find out that Europcar owns Fox. Once I found that out I then had to take a shuttle off-site to the Fox location. Once I was at the Fox location, I had to wait about 25-30 minutes to pick up the car because the checkout process per customer takes so long. There were only 3 customers ahead of me. I was happy to see that despite these difficulties the van I rented was ready to go and was the van I booked. The van looked new and was easy to drive. I will say that there was a fishy smell in the van. Also, the tire pressure in one of the tires was low and the warning light for this was on when the van was given to me. It would have been nice if Fox took care of these things before handing over the van to me. There are some positives about booking with Fox/Europe car. The price was reasonable and the staff that worked at the counter were friendly.",3,US,"June 10, 2023"
"I travel monthly to the West Palm area and this has been my second time using this location. All of the staff are extremely helpful, kind and go out of their way to assist with any situation.

I had a great experience! The car was clean and much less expensive than the ones at the airport. The shuttle drive was very short and they pick you up right by the rental car area at the airport. Everyone on staff was very friendly. The shuttle drivers gave good conversation and the person who checked the car in was friendly. I will definitely rent from Fox again.,5,MX,"June 13, 2023"

"Omar was a pleasant encounter, made this transaction smooth and easy.",5,US,"June 08, 2023"
"When we went to check out the car the customer service person was more like a sales person. He rushed through added expenses and tried to get us to upgrade our vehicle choice, plus this & that.He was pleasant enough and joked around which was okay, but I had my receipt from Priceline and asked him why the difference in price. Only then did he take the time to go into the added expenses and then I picked what I wanted added. There is enough stress when you step off the plane in a state where you have not been before, I didn't feel I needed the extra!",3,US,"May 29, 2023"

"The Fox Rent a Car office at the San Francesco International Airport (SFO)is the best!  My wife & I traveled to SFO to attend a wedding. Airline did change our flight times, which affected our rental pick-up & return.  Lily, at the front desk, did a fantastic job checking us in & getting us a great vehicle!  Upon return, Veronica, the Branch Manager, and Edgar, who shuttled us back to the hotel near the airport, were  professional & very friendly!  Because of these 3 individuals, Fox Rent A Car deserves a 10 out of 10 rating.",5,US,"June 07, 2023"

"Everybody says that you’ll have problems with Fox car rental, my last 2 trips (Phoenix and Salt lake city) was very great, despite the Fox in Salt lake city isn’t in the airport like all other companies, you need a shuttle approx 8-10 mins.

The experience was easy from shuttle to pickup and back again.  I liked being able to select our vehicle from the ones available in the class I wanted.  Drop off was equally simple.,4,US,"June 01, 2023"
The lot has no lighting and you have to call a taxi before or after business hours. This is not safe.,3,US,"June 04, 2023"

This is the WORST car rental ever! Do not book from them. I booked a car which I tried to cancel because my flight got canceled due to the Canada wildfire and the employee would not allow me to cancel. Now I don’t have money nor a flight. Please refrain from booking with this agency.,1,US,"June 08, 2023"
They had very pleasant folks at check in and check out.,5,US,"June 05, 2023"
"Check in was good and fairly fast. When I declined the insurance, I was asked for my insurance info. It took a few extra minutes because I had to find it online. Only to find out they just wanted the name of my insurance company, not the policy number, too.The car was ok, but made a lot of noises to the point I was thankful it got us through the weekend without breaking down. Otherwise, it was clean but it did have 2 dents the size of a hand, which the guy missed when going over the car with me before I took it.",4,US,"June 01, 2023"
"Fox was great! Very quick check in and out, which can be problematic in Denver. The car was perfect for our needs. The staff was very kind and friendly, too.",5,US,"May 31, 2023"

"Different class of car was provided, but follow-up service was good and acceptable",4,US,"May 26, 2023"
It’s great that one car rental agency over so many let 18 and over rent a car. The young driver fee and the cost of the car is not bad at all. Just the total of the car just basic was $635. I didn’t get the plate pass because that would cost so much extra. I’m so glad I found this agency who rents to young drivers. They also give you some more time without charge to being the car back without charge. I was supposed to bring it back 11:30 am but I had till noon if needed. It was such a great experience,5,US,"May 25, 2023"
Everything went well. Counter staff were helpful,5,US,"May 26, 2023"
"Easy pre pay pick up. I got upgraded for free since my type of car would have taken two hours to be ready. Easy sign and go, same with drop off.",5,US,"June 01, 2023"
"The first vehicle I picked up had pet feces that were unclean from the previous rental. After I returned that vehicle and got a new one, the new one worked great. Probably an isolated incident but substantially delayed my trip.",3,N/A,"May 30, 2023"
Great service so easy to book via the app and the staff at the collection were so helpful and the return was a breeze. Highly recommend Fox.,5,US,"May 19, 2023"
"Everything very easy.  Very good rental price.  Nice little car.  WATCH OUT for hours at LAX.  They close at 11:30p, so if your flight is delayed, you’re out of luck, and night Ubers are insane.",5,US,"June 06, 2023"
This was my first time renting from fox rent a car. It was a good experience. The staff was great and it was easy from pick up to drop off. I would definitely recommend fox rent a car and I will definitely be renting in the near future.,5,US,"June 03, 2023"
Car was not maintained safely. Non working headlight and worn wipers. Cruise control did not work. Tried to exchange car but procedure was way too cumbersome.,3,US,"May 22, 2023"
Rent car from Fox car rental,5,US,"May 31, 2023"
"Fox has always been easy to deal with, however, it was a bit disappointing when there were 3-4 people waiting in line when one of your team associates decided to take a break instead of waiting on the next customer.  That made it about 20 minutes longer to be waited on than it should have. One issue with being off-site from the airport, it makes it more difficult when you have several pieces of baggage.  I had to leave my family at the airport to get the car and then return to pickup them and our luggage.Returning the car I had to drop my family and luggage off at the airport and then drive back to the rental lot and then have the shuttletake me back.  Moral of the story, travel with fewer pieces of baggage or plan for some inconvenience.",4,US,"May 23, 2023"
The car we got at pick up had a terrible vibration at highway speeds.  Called customer service expecting a hassle.  Nope they connected me with the roadside assistance dept and they drove a new car out to our hotel! No interruption of our vacation.   The second car was perfect!!,5,GB,"May 31, 2023"
They charged me over £700 for 10days insurance. I pay less than half that a year on my car! Be careful because they won't tell you the insurance charges and hidden fees until you are there. They are thieves!,1,US,"April 10, 2023"
It's wonderful to have such a positive experience with Thomas and Fox Rental Car! Thomas's commitment to providing excellent customer care and addressing my concerns efficiently is commendable.

Experiences like these make customers feel valued and build trust and loyalty toward a company. Thank you!,5,US,"June 01, 2023"

Had never used Europcar before. Booked through my bank and it was super easy and fast. The car was in great condition and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable.,5,US,"May 31, 2023"
"Car was nice. Staff were polite. Two concerns:1) The tires were somewhat worn out. Got a flat tire, When I called their roadside assistance, they said they will charge $100. Attempted to change tire on my own. The tools for changing were not so good. Nuts were too tight, Had to ask for help from people with muscle. My attire got dirty. 2) Had prepaid for half tank of gas. Used only a quarter of it. No refund from Fox for the quarter tank of gas that I paid for but did not use. But for these two concerns, I could have given 5 stars.",3,US,"June 02, 2023"

"I did not expect to have to shuttle to the Fox location.  Other than that everything went well.  FYI, say no to all the insurance and upgrades and you will only pay the original price quoted.  The 4runner was a little older but served us well for the seven days we had it.  The price we paid was much cheaper than everywhere else I quoted.  I would use them again.",4,US,"May 27, 2023"
"Friendy and helpful staff, good service",5,US,"May 27, 2023"
Michelle did a great job getting my paperwork completed quickly so I could be enjoying my vacation. I have never rented with Fox. It was cheaper & the Jeep Wrangler was brand new 35 miles.,5,US,"May 20, 2023"
"Everything was spot on, the rate, deposit, and the refund, definitely will use them again",5,US,"May 29, 2023"
"When we got into our rental car at DFW, we noticed the gas gauge was well below the full mark. I mentioned it to the guy in the booth and he said not to worry, they would adjust the charges. When I got my final receipt, no allowance was made for the missing gas. Fortunately, I also took a picture of the gas gauge. Unfortunately, when I called their customer service number, they only offered me a few dollars as an adjustment for the missing gas. That saved them a bit of money over providing the gas and lost them any chance of me ever renting from them again. My suggestion is, all else being equal, you rent from someone else and, if you must rent from them, document everything, don't believe what anyone there tells you, and expect them to grab for every penny they can.",1,CA,"June 03, 2023"
If you are a Canadian traveler they pressure you to get their insurance . They tell you yours is no good in the USA.After 6 hours on a plane i just wanted to get to our rental. I agreed and also added the toll plate because i had no change. Total of the tolls for our trip if i had just paid at the tolls $36.00 for 2 weeks their charge $181.86.Beware of your rental agreement . Fool me once bad on me NEVER AGAIN FOX!!!!!,1,US,"May 12, 2023"

Staff at reception were quick, friendly and were there to resolve any issues if any. Over all satisfied with service. I would give 5 stars.",5,US,"May 16, 2023"
"Honestly, I was hesitant because of previous reviews but I had a great experience. No issues! I was alone with two kids, they helped with car seats and bags. The shuttle driver was available for both pick up and drop off at both locations. Car was clean, cold ac and great fuel mileage. The car needed to be taken in for service on the driver side for a wobble/noise concern, but other than that we would totally use Fox again.",5,US,"May 23, 2023"

"I arrived to Denver at 4:30 something in the morning. I didn't want to bother anyone to come pick me up from the airport so I had the bright idea to rent a car for a couple of hours instead of getting a lyft or uber to drive me around town. Be advised they do not accept debit cards. You must have a credit cared so that they are able to hold the $150 deposit that you will receive back once you return the car. You have the option to purchase gas with the attendant or fill it back up before you take it back. Gas station gas is usually cheaper however if you know you that you'd rather pay for convivence, get the gas from the attendant.  Taking the car back was a little confusing, it wasn't communicated well where the car was suppose to return to; another customer also returning a car helped me in the process and we worked through it together  until an attendant came to give us more clear guidance.",4,US,"May 30, 2023"
I got a brand-new Hyundai Sonata for less than 25$ a day. Jhon helped me big time and he’s very knowledgeable. Overall their entire staff knows everything and they weree great. I would recommend their services to anyone.,5,US,"May 30, 2023"
"I rented a car through Fox Rental and quickly learned that although the price seemed reasonable, they'll find a way to get more money from you. The guy behind the desk lied to me and told me the price for gas through Fox was lower than at nearby gas stations. I repeated what he said and asked him to clarify, which he did. Then he asked me if I would pay for gas from them when I returned the car. I agreed. It turned out that they charged me for a full tank of gas (and at a higher rate), even though I returned it with over half of the tank of gas still in it. When I called customer service about it, the lady couldn't understand my words, although I articulated them quite clearly. She eventually said, ""The math is simple!"" and hung up. Lesson learned! I will never do business with them again. Besides, the car was full of dents and scratches, which I rented for business and went to visit a customer. That was embarrassing!",1,N/A,"April 15, 2023"
The whole experience of pickup and dropped off was convenient and great staff. The price of the great vehicle was just right. I will rent again at this company.,5,US,"May 23, 2023"
"Out of 25+ experiences, I have yet to have a bad one. I've been using Fox Rental for over 3 years almost every month and I have yet to have a bad experience with them. Great rates, reliable vehicles, and helpful staff.",5,CA,"April 14, 2023"
"We had a great experience. Nice car, fast pick-up and drop-off. The only downside is the pre-paid full gas. The woman who handed us our car assured us that it was more advantageous. We were skeptical, but we trusted her. In the end, it cost us $30ish more. And even in a scenario where we returned the car with the tank completely empty, I don't think we would have saved any money. But hey, we learned.",4,US,"May 23, 2023"
"Reservation was Fast and easy through Priceline. Contacted Fox, set up shuttle. All the staff were great. Straightforward process, no surpise costs, car was clean. Easy pick up and return. Shuttled us right to the airport. My first time renting with Fox and I was pleased.",5,US,"May 28, 2023"

Vehicle was awesome. The service was fast and vehicle ready.,5,US,"May 27, 2023"
Great company quick check out and affordable. The shuddle picked us up quickly n took us to the airport or destination. The only think I wasn't satisfied about was anybody telling us what we need to do at drop off. And waiting around for ur turn at counter when all they could of said was leave ur keys jn the car n you're good to go,4,US,"May 28, 2023"
Vehicles I had to choose from were in bad shape interior or exterior (Scratches or dents). I finally found a decent one after going through 4 vehicles.,3,US,"May 26, 2023"
"I flew into DFW and already had my rental car booked through another larger rental company. I called the day prior to insure my rental would be ready because we have an autistic child and had to be at an appointment by a certain time. As I walk up to my rental car counter I am told that there will be a 3-4 hour wait for cars. Completely frustrated and a little angry I called my agent to see if there was any other companies there to help me. I was told there is a car shortage in DFW area and I could Uber to another airport some 20 miles away to get a car. I hung up the phone physically upset when a young man approached me. His name is William Angline. Mr Angline witnessed my frustration and asked if I needed anything. I responded yes, a rental car. He said please follow me Sir.  Mr Angline took me to his counter and set me up with the same style SUV that I was supposed to have rented from the previous company. Not only the was it same style car, but it was $100 dollars less than i was to pay with the company. Mr. Angline's actions that day went above and beyond what his job duties entail. We greatly appreciate Williams help that day as he made us fans of Fox car rental and Mr. Angline.",5,US,"May 23, 2023"

Great experience and they worked well with me. Management and staff were pleasant and easy to work with. I’d definitely rent with FOX again over all other rental car services.,5,VN,"May 29, 2023"
The staff at rental office well explained all contract details and provided us with full information. The car is new and clean. We are satisfied with the trip.,5,CA,"May 30, 2023"
Great experience.  I got deal through Capital One. Made my reservation through Capital One at the Ontario location. Fox  made the whole process very fast and easy for me. I was in and out in less than 15 minutes at pick up and less than  5 at drop off. I will definitely be using Fox again.,5,US,"May 31, 2023"
"When we got to Phoenix we were first getting kia Sorento,it had a full tank of gas,we were just ready to leave the lot,when the tenant stopped us and said we had a recall on this car,so he wanted us to switch with a toyota corolla  with was smaller,and here's the kicker,it only had a half a tank of fuel.",4,N/A,"May 16, 2023"
Jorge was great at checkin. Would have loved it if my car didn’t smell like weed inside. Ruined the experience of a rental,3,US,"May 24, 2023"
"My Worst car renting experience ever. Don't waste your time renting car there. You will loose a lot of time, nerves and money. I reserved my car rental through Expedia. I prepaid my reservation in Tampa airport only to find out after standing long time in line at the counter that car is not available. I was offered to rent a different car for almost double the pay. When I voiced my frustration and told them that I had a reservation should be honored, they told me that reservation with Expedia does not mean anything for them. In the end desperate to have a car as my family was tired and waiting all that time I was ready to pay additional cost but  they bluntly threw me out of the office refusing to rent anything just because I was unhappy and dared to voice my frustration.",1,US,"May 27, 2023"
Extremely satisfying. I don’t recall their names but i’d really thank a lady and other two guys who helped on mid night of May 25th.Their hospitality and thriving nature to satisfy a human is outstanding. I’d really love to know their names if i get chance to.,5,US,"May 25, 2023"
First thing you need to know about Phoenix airport is that it is huge. When you arrive and get luggage you need to know that you then need to go up a level and take a Tram to the car rental. This would have been helpful information to have when we made reservations.  Once we got to rental counter it was very simple process.     Returning the car was also very easy and then take the tram back to the correct terminal.  I would definitely use Fox again when I visit Phoenix.,5,US,"May 22, 2023"
"Very friendly, quick shuttle to their building and great price for a loaded mini van!!",5,US,"May 21, 2023"
i had an amazing experience with the staff and the manager Andrew was also amazing.,5,US,"May 15, 2023"
Only a minor delay at pickup due to a problem customer ahead of us in line.  Our check-in went quickly and efficiently.  The vehicle was clean and perfect for our needs and got great gas mileage. Drop off was quick and efficient.,5,TT,"May 27, 2023"
"We got a good price booking thru Capital One. The reservation line in Denver at pickup was a bit slow, but there were a lot of us. We did not get the compact car we reserved, but seems that's also so with other companies. No attendant at the return drop off, we were there 15 mins early, they later showed car as being returned 30 mins late, but we were not billed extra. The floor carpet was worn thru with a big hole, spouse got shoe snagged on it while driving, that Corolla needs a floor mat. Actually, be nice to have mats both front seats we can shake out as we had the vehicle for 3 wks. Overall a positive rental",5,US,"May 03, 2023"
"I was really skeptical about renting from an off terminal location, however, the team at Fox blew me away with how fast, efficient, and friendly they were!  Even gave me a free upgrade, which I didn’t ask for, so I was thankful for that!",5,US,"May 27, 2023"

"Very unethical business practices, as soon as you get there, they no longer have the car that was requested, and the only way to secure a vehicle is to charge the customer more. Underhanded business practices. Rent elsewhere.",1,US,"May 30, 2023"
"I rented a mini van for a one way trip from LA to Seattle. Pick up was seamless and the staff were very helpful. Drop off was equally simple. The minivan (Toyota Sienna) was perfect. So good, I wish I needed a minivan!",5,N/A,"May 20, 2023"

"It is really easy to rent and return cars.  This was the second time I'd rented from Fox, and they really facilitate your experience.  I'm a local, and I needed to rent a car while mine was being fixed.  They were the closest rental agency that actually had available cars (hailstorm had lots of people fixing theirs).",5,US,"May 22, 2023"
"Smooth check in and the representative believed me when I said the stain in the back floorboard had to be there when I picked it up because I had NO passengers. (whew!!) Word to the wise, always a good idea to also check the back floorboard when picking up your rental .... just to be safe.",4,US,"May 20, 2023"

"The clerk that helped was clear, concise and answered any questions I had. It would have been nice to have more clerks available. There were at least 15 people waiting to be helped and only 2 clerks. When I arrived there was only one.  The second came about 15 min later.  It was very obvious the second clerk was being  trained. Otherwise my experience on this day was very good.",5,US,"May 23, 2023"

Never enough workers too much up selling always at your location for more than 20 to 35 minutes. Just to get a car by enterprise. We're out of there at 10to 15 minutes tops from the time we walk in the door we don't not ask to buy 500 different things just to rent a car.,2,US,"May 19, 2023"
"Good value - fine car - easy process for pick-up and drop-off. Shuttle service was a bit confusing; two cans drove by without picking up on the way back to the airport. Counter staff person was not particularly helpful — just went through her motions without making sure the customer was following. The tiny screen for signing and initialing the contract did not allow for full reading of the contract before signing, and the counter staff person was not helpful or responsive about that defect in the process.",4,US,"May 15, 2023"
Reliable and sweet,5,N/A,"May 23, 2023"
you guys need to install more signs when returning your cars. Because there are not many or any sign or directions to get to your return location. i went into Hurts parking lot by mistakes and they gave me hard time to get out of their parking lots thinking i was stealing their car or something. you guys really require more signs/directions when returning your vehicles. otherwise overall experience was fluid and perfect. i would rent vehicle from your place for sure again. thanks,4,US,"May 22, 2023"
they told me gas tank was full when i got the car. i didn’t realize until i started driving that it was only a quarter of the way full. i still filled it to full when i returned it. they told me they’d reimburse me some money which they didn’t.,3,US,"May 27, 2023"
"good pricing    WAY OFF AIRPORT LOCATION.  Car wasn't beautiful, but clean and worked fine",4,US,"May 18, 2023"
"All 3 of the Fox staff I interacted with were very friendly and efficient.  Highest marks for them.It would be MUCH better if their shuttle TO airport terminal(s) went DIRECTLY to the terminal(s), instead of only to the main rental car place.  If the airport authority would not charge them ""too much"" more to have the shuttles go directly to terminal(s), I hope they will do so, to significantly improve their Customers' experience.  If the airport authority would charge ""too much"", as a somewhat less-satisfactory alternative, they could greatly increase the frequency of their shuttles to (& perhaps also from) the main rental car place.ALSO:  There need to be at least 2 (more) signs at the main rental car building, to guide arriving customers DIRECTLY to the Fox shuttle pickup location -- one inside the building, near the entrance from the terminal mini-train platform, & another one outside at the shuttle boarding location.   Current LAME signage directs arriving customers to an exit all the way to the far right end of the rental car building,  But then outside, you have to walk (outside) all the way back to the OTHER end of the building, where the actual shuttle pickup point for Fox (at least) is!* * * I could not tell how to adjust the outside rearview mirror positions!!!  The typical adjustment controls on the Kia Sportage for that kind of mirrors were not located in the usual area on the lower area of the dashboard to the left of the steering wheel.  * * *",4,US,"May 25, 2023"

"Fox Car Rental delivered a standard SUV (Jeep Renegade) which was comfortable and fuel efficient. Service was good. Pick up and drop off shuttle service to/from the airport to their facility was timely. The process for picking up and delivering the SUV was easy. I recommend prepaying to get the best deal for your rental investment.Only issue we had was a defective passenger wiper blade which was not really a big issue as we had weather that did not require us to use the wipers. We didn’t discover this until we used the wipers to wash the windshield. We informed the company when we dropped off the vehicle.Overall, they did a good job.",4,US,"May 17, 2023"

No problem, I attempted to cancel my reservation three weeks prior and they will not provide a refund, only a store credit less $50.  Consider spending your money anywhere else.",1,US,"May 24, 2023"

Then the attendant was efficient as well as accommodating when we requested for a different car than the one that was assigned to us. Upon return, simply gave the key back and signed out and again, shuttle driver was incredibly nice and made us feel safe as he drove us to the airport. Kinda sad that they might start to eliminate the shuttle drivers as the rental offices would now be at the airport. I hope they find a role for these nice drivers!!

They were dishonest and ended up charging us an additional $322 instead of the $120 agreed upon, in hidden charges, and tacked on insurance that we declined, and refused to give the security deposit back, after we were promised we’d receive it back, by two separate agents. Customer service is horrible, with no resolution.",1,US,"May 17, 2023"

My vehicle I ordered wasn’t ready so I was given an upgrade complementary. Overall easy car rental. Thank you for the great service.,5,US,"May 08, 2023"
"Overall experience was good. People were friendly and helpful. Very easy to get to as there was a shuttle from the airport. Drop off was simple and quick and the shuttle returned us to the airport. My only complaint was that the vehicle was very unclean, especially on the inside. What appeared to be gum stains on the carpet in the rear floor boards, dashboard and center consoles were covered in dust and sticky substances. We had to buy Clorox wipes to clean before we headed to our destination. Also, there is no way to call location directly. All calls to the SLC location go through a call center which is unfamiliar with the area and just promises to leave a message for the location. I am not sure if this is the same for all Fox locations or this one specifically.",3,US,"May 02, 2023"
"The transitions from and to the airport (LAX) were swift and smooth. Also, the staff was friendly, knowledgeable and provided great service that was efficient and quick.

I will rent from them again!",5,N/A,"May 06, 2023"

I would highly recommend this company to anyone. Also, their prices are extremely competitive.",5,CA,"May 06, 2023"
"I thought the whole rental and return process was pretty streamlined and easy. They do try to up sell you a bit, which is expected, but they weren’t pushy about it so I didn’t mind.

"Had to wait approx 30 minutes for a pickup van from the airport. Ridiculously long line at the counter once we arrived. Agent advised that if we got the prepaid fuel, we'd only have to pay for the amount of fuel we used up, not a full tank. I also heard the agent helping the customer next to me say that same thing to her customer. Of course, upon return of the car, I was charged for a full tank, and when I challenged the amount, I was told that the prepaid fuel is always an agreement to pay for a full tank. So don't believe anything the agent tells you. It's a scam. Will never rent from Fox again.",1,VI,"May 06, 2023"
Mr george was very kind and assisted me with my questions i had also with directions when i was returning the car.,5,US,"May 02, 2023"

No extra fees, no hidden charges. It was only after renting with Fox that I checked their reviews on Google Maps which detailed one horror story after another with an average rating of 1.7!

"When I'm on the West Coast of the US, I always rent from Fox as I find they have great value for money rentals.  I usually rent a minivan and they are normally in great condition.

"Pickup from airport was not so great. Took about 30 minutes. We watched numerous other named car rental shuttles come and go before FOX arrived. When the shuttle did arrive the driver was so overwhelming with passengers and luggage. The luggage was in the isle. Once we arrived at fox facility everything was great. Great customer service, got our new keep quickly. Dropping it back off was sleazy also.",4,US,"April 29, 2023"

There was no line to wait on in the office and the agent was pleasant, knowledgeable, helpful and efficient.  When we got to the nearby area to pick up the car - we were told there no full size cars, would an upgrade be ok.  We said yes and were on our way to a nice small SVU.  Returning was simple and a van was waiting to take us to the terminal.  The only minor issue was that van stopped at all arrivals areas and did not first drop us at our departure area. The van drivers were both helpful and pleasant.  I would not hesitate to use Fox again.",5,US,"May 03, 2023"
It was nice to move off site to pick up the car so you are not dealing with airport traffic.  THe car was new and nice albeit was not the grade of vehicle we had selected.  The invoice was confusing and not clear what the $106 dollars additional I was charged was for.,4,US,"May 01, 2023"
The long long long waiting in line as only 2 agents were at the check in and they were trying to sell everything including the kitchen sink to all the customers on upgrades,3,US,"April 29, 2023"

"I will never rent with this company again.  I had reserved the car and paid with a credit card so thought all was well.   When I got to the counter she needed to see the credit card I had booked with.  I didn't have it and she wouldn't accept any other card from me or my husband so here we are with no recourse and no car.  She cancelled the rental, we had to go to another company and ended up paying twice as much.  This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever encountered.  They wouldn't even accept cash to pay for the rental.  Such terrible business.",1,N/A,"May 01, 2023"
good service no surprises,5,US,"April 22, 2023"

"Livia was so sweet, super helpful, patient, we talked, laughed, she got us and others right in and out. She had the line moving rapidly at 11pm. The sweet man that shuttled us from Fox to MCO (Orlando Airport) was sooo helpful! He packed our luggage from the rental car to the shuttle & then helped us off the shuttle as well, he even let us know where to go within the airport because we were completely lost. He was very respectful!! Wish I could of gotten his name but I would know his face if I seen him again. Wonderful fox crew in Orlando!! Open late, smooth and easy drop off. MUST HAVE A CREDIT CARD FOR THOSE THAT AREN'T AWARE!! (:",5,US,"April 27, 2023"

We had no wait but that had to do with the fact that JetBlue’s on time performance is not good so we were 2 hours delayed but your agent was quite nice and getting our rental was a breeze. On our return we parked where your agent asked us to and flew right through. Thank you for a great experience.,5,US,"April 25, 2023"
Marie was so kind after a long wait and long day when we got our car!,5,GB,"April 27, 2023"
"Incredibly disappointed. Our original bill was for $608. However, today we left with a total estimate of over $1400. The agent kept quoting additional charges at me and when I tried to decline he aggressively persuaded me I needed them. I was shocked when I saw the final bill, but by that time I had already signed because I am clearly dumb and impressionable. Would recommend everyone to avoid",1,N/A,"May 03, 2023"
"Great prompt customer service, fair and reasonable priced rentals and wonderful cars.",5,US,"May 02, 2023"
Fox Rent a Car is a really shady company. They told me one price then they had all of these hidden fees. I had my own insurance and I told them so. They told me fees would be refunded when I returned the vehicle. They were not and when I requested refund they said I agreed to the insurance because I initialed the contract. Don't trust these scammers!!!,1,US,"April 12, 2023"

"The price for the vehicle I chose, was great ! Beyond what was needed, our vehicle accommodated every need for our trip",5,US,"April 16, 2023"
"TERRIBLE! If I could give a negative review, I would!!After waiting in line for over 2 hours to pick up my prepaid car at the Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood airport, I was asked by the worker at the counter if I wanted to return the car with a full tank of gas or have it filled at the airport. He told me they only charge $3/gal to fill it at the airport as opposed to the $4 gal prices at the gas stations so I agree to their price. After returning the car, I get an email receipt the next day showing I was charged $3.69/gal plus extra gas fees and other hidden fees. I was also charged for a full tank of gas, even though the car was 3/4 full. When I called billing, I was told  they don't know why I'd be quoted $3/gal and they'd have to call the branch. I  told her  I can provide notarized witness statements. She asked if i still had my contract and asked what it listed as price per gal. I told her it was conveniently left blank. I also told her I have a time and date stamped picture showing the gas guage at 3/4 tank so I can prove it was not returned empty. She said she'd grant me a 1 time courtesy reimbursement of $17. I told her that's not good enough and she was to contact FLL and follow up via email. No follow up was done. I will continue to pursue. On a side note, a friend used the same branch 2 weeks prior and was charged hundreds of dollars for insurance that she clearly denied. She was given no resolution.",1,US,"April 26, 2023"
Easy and cost effective. Great staff,5,US,"April 29, 2023"
"The employees were fantastic - Very friendly, conversational and informative.  The prices were budget friendly.",5,IL,"April 19, 2023"
The ease of both the checkout and return was effortless. The price value as it relates to the car chosen was excellent. SEA-TAC rental car pickup and returns are not located at the airport. There is a shuttle service. The only unknown factor to me was my inability to pair my cell phone to the car systems. I don’t recall if this was an additional service charge or not. I suggest that they clarify that at the tIme one is filling oxytocin and confirming the rental agreement.,5,CA,"April 29, 2023"
PROMPT AND COUTEOUS SERVICE THROUGHOPUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS.,5,PR,"April 28, 2023"

"Overall good experience except for the slightly longer than usual wait for pickup at airport. Check in and return were fast and efficient. Shuttle to airport was waiting and we left for airport a few minutes after getting on shuttle. Overall, one of the better rental car experiences.",5,CA,"April 22, 2023"
Pre-paid the rental car through RentalCars.com. Turned up at the San Diego RCC to pick up car & presented my valid Canadian driver license. I was told that I needed an International Driver Permit (IDP) to rent the car & the CS rep refused to release the car to me because she told me that I had not read the Fox company terms & conditions. She attempted to cancel the rental but could not. I have read the terms & conditions to confirm that Fox accept a valid Canadian driver license for a rental without an IDP . In 30 years of renting cars in North America & Europe this is the first time I have been refused a rental car due to not having an IDP. RentalCars.com reviewed this case and they informed me that they will issue a refund of my pre-paid rental.,1,CA,"April 14, 2023"
"Great service, no hassles getting from the Airport to the rental site and the same getting back to the Airport when we returned the vehicle. The vehicles are all well maintained and in our case our vehicle was brand new. The pricing is probably the best of all the rental companies as it was half of  what most of the major rental companies were  asking.",5,CA,"April 22, 2023"
Excellent Service! No complaints!,5,US,"April 24, 2023"
"Staff was very polite and helpful. The car was great. But I feel as though I was scammed with the toll surcharge. I had to pay $13 a day when i only incurred maybe $2 in tolls. On top of that I have been twice, so $26 per day for tolls. Other than the toll issue they were fine.",3,US,"April 29, 2023"
The experience was awesome as always. There were a couple of booboo’s in the cars appearance but no one is perfect.,5,US,"April 26, 2023"

So communication was somewhat frustrating.However, my many previous experiences with the front desk agents at Fox have been good, so this particular experience was an exception.",4,US,"April 03, 2023"
"Enjoyed the ride all along our road trip through California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado & Wyoming! Thanks for providing an upgrade to a 2022 Toyota RAV4 that was the perfect companion during the 8 days of our trip and the flexibility of Fox’s customer service to extend the car rental with out any headaches",5,US,"April 15, 2023"

"I got a great deal on the rental car. It's a long way from the airport, but the shuttle runs frequently. I don't think they washed the car before I picked it up. It had some scratches on it. But it ran well.",4,US,"April 26, 2023"

We have had negative experiences before with other car rentals being too complicated checking in, not being friendly, etc. However, Fox rental car was seriously so easy.

"I used the Hopper app to make a rental car reservation, paid for VIP service so that I could have live support if needed.  I had to return the car 1 day early & Hopper was useless, they could not get a hold of FOX rental company.  You would think that if you purchased a service thru their app that they would be responsible for changes.  Instead they kept telling me that they could not get a hold of them.  So I took it upon myself to call FOX rental car & they were even worse than HOPPER!!  I had to pay extra to return the car early!!!  Over all they were both useless!!  Deleting both apps and never using them again!!  They make it hard to reach customer support.  Unless you select modify the reservation you won’t get a live person!  Even the current reservations rep would not help!  Never use FOX rental car AGAIN!",1,US,"April 27, 2023"

"Spoilt the happiness a dream holiday gave!I thought at first we managed to get a great deal on a car hire for our recent dream holiday to Orlando. The only information that was given after I’d paid in full for the car hire to wise cars was the USA company they will hold a security deposit $150 and possibly maybe charged a liability payment..When we arrived to Orlando the company were fox! At first they seemed amazing was so nice……..They were offering all sorts of extras to which I said no, I.E pay for toll roads (we didn’t need) and extra insurance and roadside assistance etc.I was then advised of charges If there was damaged to the car or an accident etc to which I agreed and signed for….baring in mind I’m agreeing to on the condition their is damage!  This worked out around £600 in sterling give or take.Only to find out that after I returned the car they sent a bill charged me for! I will point out no damage or claims were needed the car was fine! I spoke to fox billing team and was basically told tuff you signed for it! No I signed for the costs if there was damage….. this was not how it was advised to me…I made it clear this was not how it was said to me! I was ignored and said you put your Initials and signed for it…..I’m aware of the costs if this is the case then why not take the money?  why hold it??? This was because I was told they will hold the balance incase there is damage, they have even charged me for road assistance and insurance… and bunch of other stuff. After paying wise cars £471 I was not excepting to have pay another £600. I asked wise car for help but was told  to take it up with fox! As you can imagine I’m really not happy and I’m looking to take this further as miss leading, miss sold. The company know what it’s doing. Tutt tutt!!",1,US,"April 18, 2023"

This was my first experience using FOX and I will look to use them exclusively in the future due to the wonderful experience I had. The first person Jhon who helped me in the terminal was so pleasant and just great! Then on to the shuttle which came immediately and Fabio who helped me at the car rental location upon arrival and return. He was incredible! Then onto Frances who was my shuttle driver upon departure who was just so lovely and personable. These employees made my experience wonderful and sold me on using FOX only!,5,US,"April 19, 2023"

"Donna, who worked at the front desk made our entire vacation extra wonderful. This is my first time renting from Fox and I am super impressed. You would think that all car rental companies might be the same, but I have learned because of the interaction with Donna that that is not true. Not only were we in an out very quickly, but the conversation while processing our paperwork was meaningful and made enough of an impact where I still remember her name, remember the nice interaction even after our entire vacation. Well done fox.",5,US,"April 19, 2023"
Pick up and drop-off shuttles were few and far between,3,GB,"April 17, 2023"
Company wil charge you the double of their quote. Don’t even bother to ask why because but the time your bill is send you will be flying back to your home. Worst experience ever in Orlando . I was charge 357 dollars for insurance I didn’t ask and now I’m pin pong calls between billing and costumer service. Don’t even bother to rent with them .,1,US,"April 24, 2023"

"Rented a car 03/28/2023-04/10/2023 Arrived 10pm Sea/TAC airport and could not find shuttle. I called fox and was told to call in the morning. When I finally found a booth they told me this happens all the time everyday. There is only one door number 24 that gets you to your shuttle. I had made sure to get directions from fox before my flight and was told just go outside to the shuttle. No mention of DOOR 24. So an hour later I arrive at the rental terminal and I find FOX. Was not able to get the CRV I reserved so I had to settle for a Camry. Took over 15 minutes to find FOX in the very lowest level which was dark, dirty and hard to navigate. Went to the window which had a man and women inside. I waited a few minutes and finally had to knock on the window to get the attention of the staff. Got my keys and asked how I get out. Was told just drive to the left and follow the signs. Went to the left, no signs. Another 15 minutes to find my way out of that dungeon. Drove into Seattle once and when I got home I received a bill from FOX for $75.50 for tolls. $60.00 was for administrative fees. What is really grating is I only drove the car about 100 miles. They knew I was going into Seattle. Terrible company, terrible service. No way to contact anyone. There is a reason they are way at the bottom of that garage in SEATTLE. At 70 years of age and a world traveler they are by far the worst rental car company I have ever dealt with. Steer clear!",1,US,"March 27, 2023"

DO NOT RENT FROM THEM! Customer service and billing were so rude and you’ll be charged way more when you return the car. I’ve never had issues like I have with them renting a car. Your final price at checkout is not your final price!,1,US,"April 22, 2023"
Great employees who go out of their way to help. Clean and well maintained cars always.,5,US,"April 21, 2023"
Since I pre booked pick up was fairly quick. I just had to add the insurance and pay the deposit which was significantly less than other rental car companies I’ve used. We landed at Harry Reid so we had to take a shuttle to McCarren and then another shuttle to fox so the only thing different I’d probably do is land at McCarren to save a little time.,5,US,"April 14, 2023"

Didn’t know this before booking flights, prepaying for the rental, and being stranded in SLC for 6 hours on foot, alone at 22. Old enough to work on the Mississippi River, to fight and die for the country, to be sent to prison, but can’t rent a car on my own? We can do better than this",3,US,"April 14, 2023"

Very fast and efficient service. I will definitely use Fox again!,5,US,"April 02, 2023"
Pick up and drop off so easy. Most rentals you wander through a parking garage pulling luggage and family. Boom!! On the shuttle and they drop you right at your gate. Everybody was so friendly and helpful. Even the guy chasing the lady going the wrong way headed towards the tire spikes had a smile on. Thanks Fox,5,US,"April 21, 2023"
"Car was clean and fairly new. Staff was friendly and helpful. Even though we have to take their shuttle from the airport to the Fox rental facility, it was much easier for us to navigate from and to our destination from the Fox location rather than driving out of the airport traffic.",5,US,"April 19, 2023"

"I booked a rental car via Booking.com for a vehicle at Fox Rent A Car LAX in advance on March 6, 2023 for a planned trip in April to Los Angeles, California.  The reservation indicated I would receive a Jeep Grand Cherokee or similar from April 11-13, 2023 a total cost of $126.86.  I arrived at the Fox Rent A Car LAX location on the afternoon of April 11 and the customer service agent (OLUFEMI), indicated they did not have any Jeep Grand Cherokees and if we wanted an SUV he could put us in a Dodge Durango. He indicated it would be $50 per day, which was only $2 difference from the vehicle I had reserved so I agreed.  He proceeded to discuss insurance to which I asked ""Can't I waive the insurance?"". He motioned negatively and again asked me which insurance I wanted so I did choose one since the agent appeared to indicate that I did not have a choice. When I returned the vehicle, the return agent processed the paperwork and the total was significantly higher than the quoted price. He indicated the vehicle was not $50 a day, but was a considered an upgrade and the cost was an ADDITIONAL $50 per day. He also indicated I would not receive the $150 dollar back as the initial customer service agent indicated i would. The receipt I was provided indicated UPSALE. The insurance and the UPSALE definitely was deceptive practices and ""bait and switch"". I spoke to a manager who was not helpful at all. He indicated the Diurango is an upgrade, although I explained to him that his agent did not explain that and the Booking.com reservation indicated Jeep Grand Cherokee or similar. I do know that the MSRP for the  Jeep Grand Cherokee is significantly greater, so I do not understand why the Durango would be considered an upgrade with a $50 extra fee, pricing the rental for almost $100 per day. Had I been explained about the upgrade, I would have respectfully declined. The manager indicated he could not correct the pricing to honor the Booking.com reservation, all the while speaking condescendingly with a smirk on his face. He proceeded to ask me to prove what I was saying. At this time we had a flight to catch and time was of the essence. He indicated we could follow up with the corporate office and he would place notes on the account. This was the worst experience I have ever had renting a vehicle during vacation. I was lied to from the time I arrived to pick up the vehicle until the time I returned the vehicle. Four different Fox Rent A Car representatives communicated four different inconsistent statements regarding my reservation. I believe deceptive practices were employed to solidify upsale contracts and purchase of unnecessary insurance, as I have full coverage automobile insurance on my primary vehicle. All in all, the experience was horrible and I have nothing positive to say about the experience. Had I known I would end up Paying over $100 per day to rent a vehicle, I would have reserved a luxury vehicle, to which a Dodge Durango IS NOT.",1,US,"April 11, 2023"
Pick up and return is fast. The spot for returning is not convenient if you have a lot of suitcases or strollers like we had and had to carry all that stuff back to the double door.,4,US,"April 14, 2023"

"Arrived at LAX, after a long flight.Had made an online reservation for a rental at Europcar. We didn’t know, or was not made aware, that Fox Rental was operating Europcar. The shuttle from LAX was okay. And that’s about the most positive thing with that experience of renting a car at Fox/Europcar. The staff was the most least interested staff, and we were the only costumer in there. The staff were having conversations amongst them and totally ignoring our presence. Finally getting waved to the counter, being met by a woman that obviously didn’t want to be working on a Sunday, didn’t think that a friendly approach was a part of being in the service industry. If we weren’t experienced in renting cars abroad even though we were tired, we could have ended up paying $ 400 more than the actually cost. The woman at the counter tried to convince us to pay extra on insurance, toll etc. she even got very annoyed, because we were insisting on getting that deal that we actually had made an reservation for, online. Finally we got her “approval “ and the papers, and went to pick up a class c car - that wasn’t there. A helpful person in the pick up area got a car that was in the clean up area. Mileage was 55.000, it wasn’t very clean inside, lots of scratches and marks on the outside, and very low tire pressure- well, I suppose that’s the standard nowadays!?  we spend almost 1 hour at this Fox rental LAX which could have been a smooth and easy process. I hope that Europcar, as the well renowned rental business in most of Europe, will attend to the issues with Fox Rental in LAX, it can’t be good for their business and reputation abroad.",1,US,"April 02, 2023"
Pick up and drop off was smooth.,5,US,"April 12, 2023"

Fox should have your reservation ready - or give you a similar car and get you on your way. Fleet might be a bit older. Car they gave me had 74,000 miles on it. Return staff very nice.

They have late night hours and Customer service is great, not pushy or trying making more money from you.  We had a Free upgrade since the last were taken as we got to the warehouse for pick-up.

"I recently rented a car from Fox AUS and I have to say, the experience was fantastic. From start to finish, everything was seamless and stress-free. One of the standout aspects of my rental experience was the exceptional service I received from Christina. She was incredibly friendly and professional, and took the time to answer all of my questions and ensure that I was completely satisfied with my rental.Christina's commitment to customer satisfaction was truly impressive. She made it clear that the happiness of the customers was the company's top priority, and I could tell that she genuinely cared about ensuring that my rental experience was a positive one. Her attention to detail and dedication to providing excellent service really made a difference, and I felt like a valued customer throughout my time with Fox AUS.In addition to the excellent service I received, I have to say that I was also impressed with the quality of the rental car itself. It was clean, well-maintained, and drove smoothly throughout my time in Austin. As a Californian visiting Austin for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised by how welcoming the city felt, and having a reliable rental car made exploring the city all the more enjoyable.Overall, I would highly recommend Fox AUS for anyone in need of a rental car in Austin. Christina and the rest of the team truly went above and beyond to ensure that my experience was a positive one, and I couldn't have been happier with the service I received. If you're looking for a reliable and friendly car rental company in Austin, look no further than Fox AUS.",5,US,"April 03, 2023"
My flight was super late so I couldn't pick-up my car til the next morning. The staff was very friendly and fast.,5,US,"April 04, 2023"
"The staff member was friendly, the pick up process was fairly quick. However; the vehicle that was available to me had so much body damage that I truly believe Fox should not be renting it out to customers. The front windshield was cracked as well, very unsafe and I am sure an Insurance claim was made. Take this Toyota Camry off the road until it is repaired. Sincerely, Ms. Sabrina",4,US,"April 08, 2023"
Atlanta has a Great team.Management to service people!😁😁,5,US,"April 10, 2023"
"The lady and the front desk was very nice and upgraded my rental after I presented my military ID. It was my first time renting with Fox and I 100% recommended it, the price is very affordable.",5,US,"April 07, 2023"
The cost for the car was reasonable. There was no place for a person dropping me off to wait to make sure I got a car.  The car I rented was older and sounded like it was falling apart. It did get good mileage. Returning it was confusing and I had to circle the lot twice before I found an employee who gave me directions on where to leave it.,3,CO,"April 06, 2023"

"The pickup team in Salt Lake was friendly, fun and efficient.  There was no wait and the car was perfect.  The drop off experience in Las Vegas was also great.  The young man who check me in was efficient, friendly and helpful.  The shuttle driver (Clinton) was also super nice and efficient.  I was hesitant to rent from Fox because of some bad reviews on line and the deal seemed to good to be true, but my experience was exceptional.  I got an unbelievable rate (minivan one way from Salt Lake to Vegas for 4$/day) and the staff seemed genuinely happy to have saved me over 1000$ compared to Hertz.  I would definitely rent from Fox again. Management should recognize the super employees in Salt Lake City and Las Vegas and I hope they all get a bonus.",5,US,"April 04, 2023"
The cars need to be serviced better the car had a bad shimmy in the past the car had no air conditioning and very little power,4,US,"April 03, 2023"
"There was a long line, but the customer service rep was friendly and helpful.  My son and his family were with us and his rental place closed at noon on Sat. so he needed a car as well.  She got us all set up in no time.  It does take longer because it takes 2 shuttles to get the car.  We allowed 3 hours total to return car and airport wait time.  We still had 1 hr. to spare.  Very happy with the prices at Fox, and the service.",5,N/A,"April 01, 2023"

Staff was very friendly and both pickup and drop off were very easy,5,US,"April 03, 2023"
Our SUV was just what we needed for our trip. All members of the staff that I encountered were friendly & helpful.

"Nice car, great price, good service.",5,US,"April 07, 2023"
Kirsten & CiCi went to great lengths to make sure that my entire family was able to fit into the car that they provided us with! Their helpfulness and willingness to think outside the box was both extravagant and appreciated!,5,US,"April 02, 2023"
Check in and pickup auto experience not very good.,3,US,"March 30, 2023"
"Reasonable price, I have a history so they don't try to talk me into things I never get. Good variety of cars. Easy in and out.  No checkout booth or tire punching barricades.  Simple check in and out procedures.",5,US,"April 03, 2023"
"Don't do it! I stupidly went with them to save some money and man, do I regret it! Our flight was cancelled and re-booked for 24 hours later. I immediately got on the phone with them to let them know and they said since I had already paid in full, they could only hold the car for 12 hours. If I didn't pick it up by then, I forfeit the car and the payment. That doesn't even make sense! I paid for the car for 5 days. Who cares if I only use it for 4. I tried several times to speak with someone but they wouldn't budge. They took my money and I ended up having to rebook a car, but this time with a reputable company. I'll be asking my cc company to reverse the charges. Unbelievable!",1,US,"April 11, 2023"
Nice clean car at a reasonable price.The car retrieval / return layout & flow at PHX could stand to be improved a lot thought.,4,US,"April 08, 2023"

"The rental desk was closed by the time we could get to the rental counters. Our flight came in about 10 minutes late, but by the time we could get to the baggage claim and then take the tram to the rental cars, Fox had already closed for the night. They were the only company closed, so we had other options if we knew they could close before we got our car. We were lucky that our house was within an Uber ride of the airport, but the hours should be noted in the reservation prominently so people coming in late know they may be closed before pickup.",3,US,"March 30, 2023"
"Aside from facility not being near airport, my experience was generally good.",4,US,"April 07, 2023"
"First time renting a car from Fox. It was a better experience than I was expecting. They helped us at the counter right away, they gave us clear instructions about where to go to find the Fox rental garage. When we got there they upgraded us on our vehicle because they did not have our requested size. We were on the road pretty quickly.",5,US,"April 03, 2023"

"I booked a (cheap) minivan and finally got it. The employee who served me, however, tried by all means to impose a more expensive car on me, which was quite annoying. In the end, he gave me the more expensive version, as he said, for free - which was equally untrue, because a cheaper version of the car model was not available anyway due to the manufacturer.The car was clean and drove very well, but the fuel consumption was very high. It was unfortunate that Fox did not offer a fuel-efficient hybrid version of the minivan, in California!",4,US,"March 23, 2023"

Fox has very reasonable rates and excellent customer service representatives.  They also have quality vehicles.,5,US,"March 30, 2023"
"I mainly dealt with Zach and Alonzo at the DIA location. Both wonderful and personable. As my first time renting a vehicle, they made sure I had all the info and help I needed.

This was first time using Fox and everything was excellent.  Looking forward to using them this coming September.,5,US,"March 30, 2023"
"Fox provided an excellent car at a great price. The only downside was the time it took to be shuttled from the airport to Fox (2 hours from wheels down to driving off the lot), but it was spring break and mco was a zoo...pretty sure the delay was out of Fox's control",5,US,"March 22, 2023"

"STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTSIf I could give no stars I would, this company is horrible at customer service and wont deal with the customer. My flight was cancelled, and I had to cancel my reservation. I am still fighting with them to get refunded the money for a car I never rented because of something out of my control. I called twice and was hung up on both times. When I contacted the online service company, they started the refund process and Fox is refusing to honor the refund.In reply to fox rent a car, I did sent it to the company I used to book and they informed me that you will not be giving me a refund.",1,US,"March 25, 2023"

Lowest price through Hopper (prepaid); I'll confirm there were no additional/dupicate charges.",4,CH,"April 03, 2023"
"Overall good experience, I would recommend Fox anytime. Vehicle was also good, but the windshield wipers were all torn out and AC was not cooling at all. These are the things you normally find out only once you use it and do not test them during pickup inspection. Fox should just pay a bit more attention to these areas too.",5,US,"March 21, 2023"
Our pickup was quick and simple. Return process was smooth and the service was top-notch.,5,US,"March 29, 2023"

The front desk worker that helped me was amazing I wish I could remember her name but she was very friendly and had a nice conversation with me about the trip 5 star service. With car that I got the apple car play only worked if i plugged in my phone and the heat/ac had a damp smell whenever I would turn it from hot to cold but the car ran well and got me where I needed.

"The only reason I am giving fox rental car one star because I had to be able to write a review.While on vacation in Islamarada Keys Florida, I went to grocery store and came out to a dead battery.My husband was offshore fishing so I called fox roadside, they told me they couldnt send me a replacement car NOR could they send me assisantace it would be EASIER for me to go get a battery, make sure I PROVE to FOX the old battery was dead before purchasing OUT OF MY OWN POCKET and replace the battery.  For those who know the florida keys isn't easily accessible to this.I called my own AAA membership and they couldn't send someone for 2 hours...needless to say I had groceries go bad, I was able to hitch a ride back to rental house and had my husband deal with car next day.My husband had to go to dead Fox rental car, struggle to remove old dead battery, also checked the oil which was BLACK obviously never changed, since car didn't even have 70k miles, he had to drive 40 miles to nearby advance auto, pay $266.58 out of pocket for new battery, buy oil, and get a print out of battery fail test for proof to Fox rental.Drive back to dead fox car, install new battery, all on our vacation which we work hard all year to take.Now, I am having to jump through hoops to get reimbursed for out of pocket costs from Fox rental, they haven't even offered to reimburse us for time away from vacation or spoiled groceries.Note to self:  It pays to pay more for reliable rental car service AND good customer service.I never heard of fox car rental, now i know why!",1,N/A,"March 10, 2023"
"The agent at the counter (Diana) was grumpy and manipulative. I handed her my expired license. ""I can't accept this,"" was her response with no eye contact, empathy, or suggestions. I had a temporary current license, so we continued on. She told me I would need to pay a $90 ""early"" fee. I asked her to consider the fact that I was only 26 minutes early. She replied with a statement about availability, which made sense, but we learned there were three cars available, one of which we took and used. She pushed the insurance on us, and would not accept an expired Gieco ID card. We used our app to show her our current ID card. She talked us into spending $13/day for toll pass, which we used twice the entire trip. Finally, she started to charge us $13/day for my wife to drive the car. When we questioned her, she replied, ""Oh, I didn't know you were married. You have to tell me stuff like that. How am I supposed to know that your common last name doesn't mean you are brother and sister?"" The whole experience was absolutely horrible. The agent was grumpy, pushy, and dishonest.",1,US,"April 02, 2023"

"I returned the car after I had been involved in an accident. It was my first time dealing with an accident in a rental. The General Manager, Shae DeVaughn, and her staff made the process of processing the damaged vehicle as smooth and stress-free as I can imagine. Their positive, helpful, and professional approach was impressive and above and beyond my expectations. I was on the shuttle to the airport in little more time than if there had been no accident. This was the case even though there had been some miscommunication between me and my credit card insurer. I had never dealt with Fox before this trip. Because of my experience with the PBI folks, I will recommend Fox to my friends and will seek them out on my future travels.",5,US,"March 31, 2023"
"It was quite easy to rent a car here. The staff was friendly and efficient at getting us on our way. The car ran good. Price was as expected. You do have to take a shuttle, but it was quite fast we didn't wait very long before it arrived.",5,US,"March 24, 2023"

"I made a reservation to pick up a car through Fox car rental at the Miami airport for 12:30 a.m. The website indicated shuttles were available at that time and the location closed at 12:59 a.m.After my flight arrived right after midnight, not only were there no shuttles available, the location had closed before the said time. My family and I had to wait at the airport for over 5 hours before the location reopened. It also indicated the shuttle service resumed at 5:00 a.m. We waited until 5:30 at the airport and ultimately had to Uber to pick up our car.Mohammed checked us in… I explained what happened and his only explanation was “our hours/shuttle service has changed since covid” Also, if we arrived any later, our reservations would have been cancelled and the car would have been rebooked because they were low on inventory. I said I had already prepaid for the car and he said it didn’t matter because I booked through a third party.I inquired about adding my husband as an additional driver. Mohammed told me if I wanted to add my husband, it would be an additional $20.00 per day. I asked if spouses were included without a charge and he said no…. $20.00 per day. So I left without adding him.I also asked about returning the vehicle in the morning instead of noon because our flight was first thing in the morning. I was told if I returned the car earlier I would be charged $50.76 to return the vehicle 6 hours before.Soon after we left, I noticed the engine light was on and the drive itself was worrisome. The car engine was extremely loud, turbulent ride, couldn’t speed over 70 miles per hour without the engine shaking/rattling and the windshield wipers streaked. It was an extremely dangerous vehicle to drive.The following morning I contacted customer service about switching cars. I had to drive an hour each way to The Fort Meyers location and the customer service was absolutely amazing there… extremely professional! They put me in a different vehicle.I was curious about the additional driver so I read the terms and conditions on Fox’s website. It indicates spouses are eligible as an additional driver without an additional fee, so yet again, I had to drive an hour each way to the Fort Meyers airport to add my husband to the policy.I don’t understand why Mohammed was so rude, unprofessional and why he blatantly lied to me with incorrect information. He also charged me with several miscellaneous small charges that were not included on my initial reservation. Such an unprofessional person to represent the company. I would NOT recommend this company. Waste of my time.",1,CA,"March 28, 2023"
Great check in - did not take long and the staff member was very nice.,4,US,"March 24, 2023"

"I only waited a few minutes at the airport for the shuttle to Fox Rent a Car. My rental car was ready when I arrived at Fox and the process to the key get only took a few minutes. Staff were friendly and provided good, prompt service.",5,US,"March 29, 2023"
Our plane at John Wayne Airport in Orange County California was not supposed to land in time to get to the car lot so we booked our car for the next day. But our plane did land early and we went straight to the car lot and they were able to give us a car a day early with relatively little cost added. The agent was so helpful!,5,US,"March 23, 2023"
"The Fox in San Diego is awesome! So helpful, efficient, happy and patient. She knew how to think outside the box to make our rental experience work last minute. So very appreciative! The cars were in great shape. Overall a major win!",5,US,"March 26, 2023"
"Everything was clear about our rental, including costs. We knew we would be driving on toll roads and opted in for the toll fee expense. There was an additional expense associated with dropping the vehicle at a different location, but we were aware of the fee, and even with it, Fox was more competitively priced than rental agencies that did not have extra fees. Went great!",5,US,"March 25, 2023"
The roads were very snowy and was able to upgrade to a 4 x4 which saved the quick weekend trip.,5,US,"March 24, 2023"
"Great customer service! Everything went really smoothly from the minute we arrived till the day we left. I recommend that when people place an order , that you tell them what to look for when arriving at the Airport. Make sure they know the name of the car rental “Fox”.We had a hard time since we didn’t really know what company we had rented through since we went through Capital One Credit Card.",5,US,"March 22, 2023"

Off airport shuttle came quick and my car was available right away.  I was in the building for less than 10 minutes.I had requested a 4wd/awd but was not given one and the tires were worn out. It was past 11 and I did not realize it was a  fwd suv till later.,4,US,"March 28, 2023"
"Although the transfer from one shuttle bus to another may not be as convenient, the experience renting a car from Fox Rental was wonderful! Friendly service both at the lot and on the shuttle.  They clearly explained what we needed to do upon return & what amount of time we needed to get to the airport on time.  The car was clean and offered less than 20,000 miles and was exactly what we requested.  We would not hesitate to use them again.",5,US,"March 30, 2023"

"How satisfied were you with the member of staff who served you at pick-up? The pick-up people are friendly, helpful, professional, and kind. Very efficient! Super easy pick up. Oh, and the last time I rented, same experience with pick-up. One tire was nearly bald that was perhaps missed during a check-in. Pick-up exchanged the vehicle for a different one with an upgrade. The safety issue was rectified instantly. How satisfied were you with the vehicle provided? Excellent. Except, what I would like to learn is how to turn off the auto functions that control the vehicles steering (car assistant I think it's referred to as). This was unintentionally turned on my me when thinking I was turning on the cruise control. It was not. Even after pulling over, turning the vehicle off, the auto assistant would not disengage.How would you rate your experience when returning the vehicle? Excellent, very efficient, and easy.Thank you for a wonderful experience,Carolyn GreencandidCarolyn®04/02/2023",5,US,"March 29, 2023"
"For an unbelievable price I rented a Nissan Murano for 10 days.Upon arrival waited for shuttle for about 15 minutes at 10 pm….on departure end, at 4 pm we pulled up, signed pad, hopped on shuttle and that was it! So easy! Only complaint, there was no windshield wiper fluid…",5,US,"March 29, 2023"

"Normally, I rent with Enterprise as I am a corporate customer... however, on this occasion I had to rent last minute and there were no cars available. Did a search, and Fox was recommended and the least expensive... so I took a chance, even though I'd never heard of the company. I have to say, I was so very surprised, and pleasantly so. I walked past lines of people at the other counters, and I had no wait at all at the Fox counter. The counter person was pleasant and helpful, and the pick up was a breeze... as was the drop off. The car was older (about 80k) and had some wear and tear, but it was clean inside and drove like a champ. I had no problems and was impressed enough that should I ever end up in a similar sitation, I'll definitely look up Fox again. Grateful.",5,US,"March 23, 2023"
"The experience was what I expected the service was good, the only thing was the tire tread there was not much left. Driving on the California freeways with all the rain I didn't feel safe.",4,US,"March 29, 2023"
The guy at the desk tried to sell me a $30 toll pass. (Two tolls we went though were $1.50 each) Also told me they were .15 cents cheaper on gas if I had them fill up instead of me doing it. I spent way more having them do it. I felt lied to about these two things just for them to make a buck. Car shook at 20mph every time when accelerating. Felt like transmission was about to drop out. The 2020 Ford Edge needs serviced. I was just praying to make it through our time and not get stranded.,3,US,"March 25, 2023"

"Since I understood the 2 shuttle pick up and drop off process, I had no problems.  The check in went well and the wait was nominal.  I had already purchased added insurance from AARP beforehand.

Cost and size of car.,4,US,"March 08, 2023"
"They didn’t have the suv I rented and ended up with a different car which was kind of a problem since I had many pieces of luggage but we manage. Also ended up paying for extra insurance what was never mentioned that was needed, that was an additional $200. It will be nice to be able to have an additional alternative person to do the car pick up, I was with my wife and 2 little kids, this could have save us some time and headache. Except for that everything went well.",3,US,"March 15, 2023"
"Outstanding customer service from start to finish. I was hesitant by the negative reviews, but the price was fair compared to the competition, not breaking the bank for a three-day rental was a plus renting from Fox.  I will definitely be a returning customer.",5,US,"March 24, 2023"
The staff was very professional and courteous. Keith was more than helpful when we returned. Great staff!,5,CA,"March 27, 2023"
Great experience overall and great car except the agent at the desk in L.A. close to LAX that made me think it was required by state law to purchase liability insurance through them despite me having my own personal insurance which covers liability insurance. He acted nice about it to make it sound like this was a normal practice. It cost $13.99/day plus tax so it came to over $125 overall. Not cool at all and I am not pleased by this.,3,N/A,"March 18, 2023"
"Good price. new, clean vehicle.  Nice people.  Very long wait at the counter line. Issue with final bill which was resolved by customer service.  While it did not happen to me, be prepared for upsell attempts for vehicle upgrades and insurance.",4,US,"March 20, 2023"

Check in and drop off were fast and easy. I received a brand new Camry after reserving a smaller car. Great experience.,5,US,"March 23, 2023"
"Fox is the worst I would NEVER use them again. Rented a car from OAK. Took 45 mins to check in. They couldn't verify that I had pre-paid via Expedia and I had to send a random email to confirm my reservation. They also didn't have the car I reserved (Jeep) and I had to get a Camry instead. Now I am in a dispute with them about paying a bridge toll even though I have already sent them the confirmation documents that I paid (and they are trying to charge me a $15 admin fee on top of the $7 toll). AVOID at all costs!!!Even though Fox rental cars has responded to me, it took them over 10 days to reach back out to me after my initial email and they only responded to me the day after I submitted a dispute claim with my credit card company (timing isn't coincidence in my opinion). I also tried to call their customer service department while the charge was still pending and waited for 45 minutes and then hung up. It is literally impossible to get a hold of their team!",1,US,"February 25, 2023"
"Rental car and experience were acceptable, but I had to call to have my $150 security deposit release even INITIATED after 7 business days (3-5 business days is the promise I received when I turned my car in). I asked why I had to call to have this done, which of course, could not be answered. I doubt very seriously that it ever would have been processed, if I hadn't pursued. I am told that it will take an additional 24-48 hours for my refund to process. That seals the no-trust and no-business in the future for me.",2,US,"March 18, 2023"
Good pick up.. fast return! Friendly staff,5,US,"March 24, 2023"
"Our SUV rental in Phoenix was a great value as compared to what other car rental companies had to offer.  The vehicle was in great condition both aesthetically and mechanically.

"The Car's Brake pads had a constant  loud squeal almost the entire time I was driving, but the Vehicle was nice. Fox should warn customers at reservation that there will be an extra $150+ dollars needed for a deposit before you get the car at the checkout counter.",3,US,"March 15, 2023"
"Both the person checking us in and the person at the car return were friendly, courteous, and efficient. That was a five-star experience. The vehicle gets a one-star. I asked for a small to medium size SUV. The vehicle we were given was a Mitsubishi. I believe an Outlander Sport. We were a little disappointed with that vehicle. It was clean and in good working order but it is, frankly, a cheap tin can with no acceleration. And we are used to a little more interior room. That's just personal preference. Your employees are top notch.",5,N/A,"March 14, 2023"
"The great price is what started my interest in Fox Rent a Car. I had never used them in all the years we rented a car in Las Vegas. Once I made my reservation purchase, I began reading the less than favorable reviews of the company. To say the least I was concerned. When we arrived at the Las Vegas Rent a Car Center the shuttle was arriving to take us to Fox Rent a Car.  The driver was  absolutely a delight explaining where we were going and how to return our vehicle at the end of our trip. We were driven right up to the Fox Rent a Car center front door. We immediately walked up to the counter and was assisted by a very polite and professional gentleman. We were on our way to our rental in less than 12 minutes. No long lines, no high pressure upgrade sales pitch or rudeness. Just a pleasurable experience. The return was just as fantastic. Great people and a good company to do business with.",5,US,"March 12, 2023"

"Staff members at Fox made our car rental experience very smooth. We reserved the car through Expedia in Canada and we got a similar type of vehicle waiting for 5 minutes. Insurance and adding an extra driver were no problem. We left with a full tank of gas. The billing is a bit confusing, with extra taxes and fees, but we ended up getting a refund for gas and returning car in good shape, so in the end the bill was what we expected. We would recommend Fox in Phoenix to other drivers as they made the process as easy as possible.",5,US,"March 22, 2023"
Everything  was great from start to finish no worries  in and out on time no hold ups good experience,5,MX,"March 11, 2023"
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS -- THEY WILL LEAVE YOU HIGH AND DRY AND NOT GIVE A DAMN. I used an online service to book a car with Fox in San Antonio. I am a US citizen, but I have lived in Mexico for 18 years. I have a US passport and a Mexican driver's license. I am also a permanent resident (green card holder). This has never been an issue in the past. My husband and I were traveling to the US to renew my military ID card (retiree) and to take him to a doctor due to some very serious, and very worrying, medical conditions. Without going into great detail, his health is poor and he can only walk short distances. He required a wheelchair when we were traveling. So, with great difficulty, we get to the Fox counter to do the paperwork for my rental. Right before we got there, we saw another set of people leaving, quite upset. Not wanting to be rude, we didn't listen, but it was clear something wasn't right. I get to the counter and my first impression was that the woman would rather have been filing her nails than deal with a customer. She made it clear that I was a nuisance. No ""Good afternoon"" or ""How can I help you?"" No, instead she just glared at me to see what I wanted. Yes, my back was up by that point. Was I rude then? No. I just smiled and said I had a reservation in the name of ""Me."" She didn't ask, she demanded my driver's license. I handed it to her and explained it was Mexican but I'm a US citizen. She ignored that and demanded (yes, demanded, she was not professional and was a very poor representative of the company) my passport. I gave it to her. She immediately said that I couldn't rent a car because MY PASSPORT AND DRIVER'S LICENSE HAD TO BE FROM THE SAME COUNTRY and that it was in the Expedia agreement and on their website. Um, no, it's not. Unfortunately, I didn't have that info at the time, but I did go back afterward to Expedia and this is what it actually says:   QUOTE    The driver must present a valid driver's license and credit card in their name upon pick-up. The credit card is required as a deposit when renting any vehicle. The deposit amount is held by the car rental company. Please ensure sufficient funds are available on the card.International rentals may have different driver's license requirements. An international driving license is required if the driver's license is non-roman alphabet.  UNQUOTE  Nowhere does it say that the driver's license must match the passport...and might I point out that Mexico uses the same alphabet, i.e., Roman, as the United States. I went to the actual Fox website and pulled up the restrictions for Texas. They say:  QUOTE: Fox Rent A Car, Inc. will only accept US domestic Drivers Licenses when renting any Jeep Wrangler. This includes EFAR (2-door Wrangler), XFAR (4-door Wrangler), and XRAR (Sahara). This applies at locations in Arizona, Texas and Southern California.Please see the PAYMENT Policy for complete drivers license requirements and rental qualifications.  UNQUOTEI even tried to show her my green card to prove I had valid Mexican residency. She barely looked at it or me. By that point, I admit I was steaming. No, I didn't curse her out but I did rant about how the webpage didn't have anything like that. Hubby was also pretty upset and made some comments but again, we did not curse; we did comment on the inanity of this policy (clearly made up). I had been up since midnight. I was tired, my husband could barely walk and this ""representative"" of the agency couldn't have given less of a toss if she had tried. If this is what Fox wants to represent them, then they deserve to go bankrupt. I also noticed that those of us who got turned away were white and Mexican -- the two pilots of our plane got turned away, too! I guarantee their passports matched  their drivers' licenses and they definitely had cars available since ours was now up for grabs!Ending:  I was desperate. I went over to the agency right next door and pled my case to the gentleman working there. He was GREAT. He had no issue with my license and had a car available. It was more expensive, but I didn't care. I was signed up and out within 15 minutes. Since I can't mention their name here, I will just say that it involves a ""t"" added to the number after five. I got a sporty little Bronco and got the heck out of the airport.",1,CA,"March 21, 2023"

Vu even knew about some local Vietnamese restaurants we should check out. I've seen other customers wait in big lines at Fox in the past, but our experience was A+ exceptional.",5,US,"March 11, 2023"
The overall rental experience was excellent. From pick up to return. Especially the return was extremely efficient and fast. Thank you.,5,US,"March 21, 2023"

Always a great experience at Fox Burbank airport,5,US,"March 18, 2023"

"We had a great experience with Fox, everything went very smooth!",5,CA,"March 09, 2023"
"We rented through Expedia and when we did we took out an insurance policy from Expedia.  When we arrived  at Fox my husband went to rental desk.  He was unaware of the insurance we took from Expedia and the Fox representative didn't make him aware that there was already insurance on the vehicle.  Instead he sold him an additional insurance policy, very underhanded.  He shoud have seen on the reservation that insurance was already paid for.  I won't rent a car from this company again.",1,CA,"March 12, 2023"
Had a great experience. Very easy drop off and pick up. And we had a very nice vehicle. Especially for the price !I'll use fox again.,5,US,"March 13, 2023"

"I have seen many negative reviews concerning Fox, so I a bit nervous. The initial pickup at the airport was very easy. Within about 20 minutes we were at Fox. Once there I was immediately given service at the counter. There were no oversells of anything additional. If you are from the NY area, bring your own EZPASS, you can use it with no problems. The car itself was 3 years old, but ran very well. The return process was completed within minutes and I received my receipt via email immediately. I was then taken onboard the transportation back to the airport. Again about a 20 minute drive to your terminal. The drivers on the vans were very nice and respectful. The communication of the process was well explained.",4,US,"March 15, 2023"
"I was a bit  skeptical at first renting from fox from reading past comments. I was pleasantly surprised the entire process and car that was given was very good. No extra charges or issues. I would rent from fox again. The only question I had was upon pick up process the rep asked if for a few extra dollars if I wanted to upgrade, when I declined she offers me the same upgrade with a so called discounted rate. Why not have offered me that price originally and perhaps I would’ve upgraded. But either way the car proved was clean and enough for my needs",5,CA,"March 08, 2023"
"Ignore the occasional negative reviews, my experiences with Fox have been great. This is probably the third or fourth time I’ve used them and no issues.  No additional charges (or insurance) to what I’ve been quoted plus they have competitive. Don’t simply rely on reviews, sadly most comes from unhappy clients :(",5,US,"March 20, 2023"
After having some issues at a car company place we were directed here and SOO glad we were!!! After such a stressful morning victor took amazing care of my boyfriend and I. Had some issues with the booking online and victor took care of that immediately. He really turned our day around! By far the easiest pick up and drop off process too. Quickest as well. Huge bonus!!! Especially in the middle of spring break busy! Cannot recommend victor and this company anymore. Wish I’d caught the drop off guys name because he was great as well. Will definitely be my go to from here on out no questions asked. If you’re thinking of booking here this is your sign to do it!,5,US,"March 14, 2023"

"The experience with Fox was pretty seamless, although I did find the cleanliness of the vehicle lacking but it wasn't the biggest deal. The allow you to go in and pick from the fleet and there was a big difference in vehicle condition as we looked around. The vehicle return was also a simple process of dropping off and paying. The customer service was friendly and efficient. I would rent from them again.",4,PR,"March 12, 2023"

"Fox is a total waste. I rented through priceline 2 weeks before my trip. I arrived at the Jacksonville airport on time and was told by the shuttle driver that they ""had overbooked"" and there were ""no cars available"" I was forced to rent at another agency. After my trip, I saw the FOX rental charge on my VISA and called Priceline and was told that FOX had me listed as a ""NO SHOW"" THIS IS AN OUTRIGHT LIE"". Priceline and FOX kicked me back and forth and neither one took responsibility for their fraud. If you want minimum acceptable service without being RIPPED OFF, use any agency other than FOX>",1,US,"March 04, 2023"

"DO NOT EVER RENT FROM THEM.  I recently rented a car from them and was asked if I wanted the toll-pass for 12.99.  It was 12.99 a day!  Also was asked if I wanted insurance and I told (name) multiple times no I already purchased insurance I do not want it.  I got a charge of 247 and I was told that was the security deposit for the car and I would only be charged 12.99 once I return the car.  None of it was a security deposit it was the charge for the 12.99 toll-pass a day and the insurance per day.  After trying to receive a refund for the insurance charge because I specifically told him no, I do not want it the company would only refund 50% of the money.  The toll pass I took blame thinking something was only 12.99 even though I was told once I return the car 12.99 is all that would be charged to my account and the remainder was the security deposit.  To make it all better the car was horrible! When I say horrible, my fiancé was worried about us breaking down on our one trip from clearwater to Orlando.  I told myself well you get what you pay, I paid a lower amount so I get a horrible car, but with the extra charges I have been charged that I said I didn't want I could have just gotten a better car from a real rental company.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!",1,US,"March 13, 2023"
Clarissa always takes care of her customers especially my husband and I. She and Laura are my favorites. Of course Amber too is helpful and accommodating. Thank you ladies.,5,US,"March 09, 2023"
Fox is an efficient from pick up to return.  The pick up counter person was friendly and made the process painless.  The return process was so quick and easy.

"Comparable prices,easy pick-up and return.",5,US,"March 18, 2023"
I was a bit skeptical since I had never rented from Fox before. The only unusual thing was having to take a 2nd bus from the rental car center to the Fox location. But this was well worth the effort because we had a great overall experience. We got a beautiful luxury minivan at a really reasonable price. There was no line when we arrived so walked right up to counter and was helped by really nice young man. Will definitely use Fox again.,5,US,"March 10, 2023"

"Rented a car for 6 days at Miami airport. Beatrice was an absolute gem! Greeted me with a smile, was informative, fast and easy to deal with. The whole experience was smooth, fast and the staff was helpful from Beatrice at the desk, the shuttle driver, to the guy that received the car at the end of the rental. I added liability insurance as I didn't have my own at that time ($13.20/D), and they accepted my credit card's damage insurance. I declined the Sunpass and bought mini Sunpass at Walgreens, activated and loaded it with $ in case I go through toll roads. Overall great experience, at a good price with no hidden fees. This will be my Go-To Car rental company from now on!",5,US,"March 17, 2023"
Unnecessary waiting to see if I would pay for an upgrade.,4,US,"March 17, 2023"
Great personal  service great car great pricing!!Our issue was with the Austin airport! They provided no transportation carts to the rental car area which if handicapped and pulling luggage is quite a trek!

"The moment of delivering the car was the worst experience of my life!  a chubby employee, who drives the bus to the airport, is the most spoiled, talkative and arrogant person in this world!  there are no signs or indications that clearly indicate the process!  in return they have -0",2,US,"March 16, 2023"
We arrived at FLL on Bahamasair airlines and it was a short walk to the rental car center where we were greeted and served by Jonathon at Fox and everything went great. Will definitely return.,5,US,"March 16, 2023"
it was easy and pretty quick,4,US,"March 06, 2023"
"If I could give them one star, I would. Absolutely horrible experience from star to finish. First of all, they had a booth at the airport just outside, and was  hard to find. Secondly, the agents working there were absolutely clueless and had no clue what they were doing. They couldn’t find the car and were clicking around to see which car it is, then they gave us a car that wasn’t even cleaned. When we got in we saw the center console was filthy. The guy reached over my aunt to clean it after the fact. Once we reached home we realized we had double paid for insurance, which we paid through Expedia (where we did the original booking). When I called the company to confirm this the agent who answered was very rude, he basically told me to go back and get it refunded when I told him I couldn’t do that he said well there’s nothing we can do. One we reached our destination the operations manager emailed us with a 10% discount and gave us the wrong license plate as the car we rented. Apparently the agents gave us the incorrect car; and marked the car we actually had as returned!! So he was reaching out once he realized the mistake. We were annoyed by this point and how this was all handled, once we finally got to the rental place. They told my aunt who we added as an additional driver there was no record of her being added yet they scanned her license at the time of the rental AND charged us an additional driver fee. The manager was completely rude and dismissive the entire time and even said they had no record of my Call even though the agent had to speak with my husband to get me authorized to speak to! They wasted all our time and added undue stress. Don’t ever rent from here.",1,N/A,"March 16, 2023"

Fast pick up. Clean car. Good price,5,US,"March 08, 2023"
Picking up vehicle rental was quick and easy except for the fact that they didn't have a vehicle in the category we reserved so we had to pay more for a vehicle in a larger category which we didn't need with no discount for their failure,4,US,"March 03, 2023"
The rental price was reasonable. Pick up and drop off were efficient. The car was in good condition and it was the size we asked for.,5,US,"March 07, 2023"

"VALUE.   This is my second experience renting from fox at SNA and both were excellent.   The vehicles had more miles, but both were clean, in excellent condition, and ran perfectly.  It may take a few more minutes to get the car depending on where you hit the shuttle cycle, but if you have the time, a few minutes to save $$$$ is worth it.",5,CA,"March 15, 2023"

Pick up in Miami is not at the airport and we were coming off  cruise and it was very difficult to get there. We were told they don’t have a shuttle to the airport so had to get an Uber to their place and it took forever since thousands of people were getting Ubers.,3,US,"March 12, 2023"
I got there they gave me a Mirage HVAC. I asked if I was a different car I was told no.   I went to go get the car and the car was not there I had to go upstairs to go get the car. But they were other small cars like the one I had requested  that we’re not a hatchback. As I had the car and I used it when I was started it started making a funny noise that is when a little wrench popped up above the speedometer. So I brought the car back early. I was told that I was going to be charged a fee for bringing you back early. Explain to them why I brought it back early and they said there was nothing wrong with the car. They didn’t started it didn’t look at it they didn’t do anything all they checked was the mileage and to make sure it had a full tank of gas coming back.,1,US,"March 09, 2023"

"Worst car rental experience ever! If you read this, do yourself a favor and rent anywhere else than Fox. Fort Lauderdale airport staff didn't let me pick-up my reserved and prepaid car because my first name doesn't fit completely on my credit card. They basically took my money and told me to go find a taxi.... The staff couldn't care less about leaving a family with kids without a car. I tried to discuss many solutions with them to solve the issue but they refuse to do anything (Use my wife credit card, change or cancel reservation, etc) They even refuse to let me use their phone so I could sort this out. Reported the issue multiple times on their website and e-mail and they don't even bother to reply. They don't deserve this single star.And no, you don't reply within 72 hours. It's been 3 weeks. Stop replying in public to make your customer service look good. It's not! Start solving the issues for real.",1,US,"February 26, 2023"

Smooth rental and return process and a great vehicle!,4,N/A,"March 13, 2023"
Price of rental was very competitive and pickup/dropoff was very quick and easy. The vehicle itself was dirty both on the exterior and interior. Also the windshield fluid spray nozzles were clogged or broken and would not spray fluid onto the windshield. This was very dangerous as we were driving in the mountains with snow and could not clean road film off the windshield.,3,US,"March 08, 2023"

"The interior of the car was extremely dirty, sand everywhere and cookies on floor in back seat.",3,US,"March 06, 2023"
"Do not rent from here. Similar to what others said, I was specifically told by the agent that I did not need to stop and pay tolls when I rented in Florida. Needless to say, I get a letter a month after I returned the rental vehicle claiming that I owe $10 for the tolls I did not pay plus $90 in administrative fees. I was also required to pay for rental insurance which is never a requirement at any other rental company. Also, this is the second time that I got told wrong information from a Fox employee. We had been in Las Vegas a couple days before Florida and we also rented with Fox since everything was booked at the same time. Long story short, don't rent here. This place is shady to say the least and I wish I could give 0 stars.",1,CA,"October 12, 2022"
Car was great. One tire needed air but not a big deal. We were upgraded to a slightly larger car. Slow at pick up. Drop off was a breeze. Wish it didn’t have the extra fees at the end. For future maybe let clients know when booking that there will be extra cost which was almost just as much as the rental to begin with.,4,US,"March 07, 2023"
"Staff were friendly, quick & courteous. Rental was so fast & so easy.",5,US,"March 05, 2023"
"I reserved a car that would fit 5 people and high enough for us as the users are really tall and polynesian big. What I got was a honda sonata, really low for two 6'3"" to get out of.

They charged double what the contract stated even though I returned the car early. When I tried to call them to ask about it I could not reach anyone. I would NOT recommend this company to anyone. Upon finally getting ahold of someone they told me that I had agreed to the insurance which I did not. I rent cars all the time and have never accepted the insurance. I feel like the attendant at the counter slipped that in falsely. I will ever use this company again. This is my second bad experience. The first time I let it go but this time I want to warn others.,1,US,"March 02, 2023"
Very easy from booking to picking up and dropping off. Our flight was moved back a few hours after I booked our vehicle. Everything was fine. Then at the airport we were delayed another hour.

"BUYER BEWARE! We rented a couple of cars for early morning pickup at FLL (Fort Lauderdale Int. Airport). Though the flight number was provided (pickup was 12:30 am, flight was delayed), the pickup counter was closed. They do not care! They closed even though the Fox site is supposed to be open 24/7 hours, based on the available pickup hours selectable. (It should be noted that since this review was first published, FOX has added online, that their counter closes at 12:30 am, LOL) Furthermore, there was no way to get in touch online or by phone to circumvent any possible issues or concerns. This was a grave inconvenience and hardship at 1:30am with children and grandchildren. In future, I would not trust FOX Rent A Car for any business, in any circumstance, or for any price saving. (BTW, no compensation or reconcilliation has been offered either, since we were lucky to find an available car,  though paying $109 more at that time !)  As well, theIr CEO, ALLEN REZAPOUR, is not professional enough to respond to my concerns.  [#WFX0621F90]    BUYER BEWARE!     THEY DON'T CARE!",1,US,"February 28, 2023"

"Tried Fox again after they outright CANCELLED my reservation in January (costing me more to rent last minute with another company). The checkin was fine, even though the female customer service agent was not friendly at all (wouldn’t even smile).  The car was fine…as expected for size and was a newer model and clean. Returning the car was concerning because there was only one employee to inspect cars and he was not issuing any return receipts. I felt like I was exposed to a claim of not enough gas in the car, damage that I didn’t cause, etc. upon receiving my return receipt via email at home, I was charged $20 more than expected for some unknown reason.",3,US,"March 11, 2023"

The personnel were very friendly and informative. Prices were reasonable too.,5,US,"March 01, 2023"
Is it possible to leave 0 stars. Horrible company. I didn’t agree to prepay for gas and yet they charged me $18.86 to top off a tank that was just filled. I sent an email to the company and called. The rep was rude and nasty. Will NEVER rent from Fox again,1,US,"March 11, 2023"

"Gods people, good experience.",4,US,"March 10, 2023"
"Pickup and return was great!However we didn’t get the intermediate suv that we paid for. We got a compact instead and no price compensation for the smaller suv. The agent wanted to argue about it. Our reservation clearly said intermediate and he insisted it was for a compact. There were only three to pick from and non of them were nice. We picked the nicer of the three. The carpet in the storage was damaged, the car had scratches all over it, inside of the windows had a film of what looked like smoke all over them and the car smelled like smoke.The car had over 75,000 miles on it and probably should have been replaced. I don’t think wholesale on that crappy car would have been what we paid for the two weeks.I’ve rented from you before and have been very happy but not this time. I realize all locations are different but I’ll have to think about Fox being my first choice in the future.",3,US,"February 24, 2023"
"The staff there is amazing.  Very helpful and nice.  The cars are clean and the best price despite my membership in other loyalty programs.  When I'm in Austin, I'm in a FOX rental.",5,US,"March 06, 2023"
The attendant was nice and courteous and willing to accommodate our need despite us not having a reservation. It was late and he was still helping with a smile in his face! Easy pick up and easy return.,5,US,"March 07, 2023"
"The intake agent, Zohair, was phenomenal!  The vehicle, a Ford Expedition, was clean and provided us with ample room for our party of six.  We rented a toddler car seat which was clean and bagged prior to receiving.  The return process was quick and easy.  The only criticism would be there is not a service desk or cars located at Orlando airport which was a slight inconvenience traveling with a child but that should not be a deterrent.  Shuttle service was great!  Will definitely rent from Fox in the future.",5,N/A,"March 05, 2023"
"Margarita was the BEST!!! Super helpful, informative and just sweet as pie!! Thanks for helping make our vacation a California Dream!",5,US,"March 06, 2023"
Be very careful with this car rental. I paid in full on Travelocity for car and insurance. I declined the insurance at the pick up area. Dropped off the car and they charged my CC for gas and insurance. Had to depute it. Scam at Fort Lauderdale Airport area. Be careful...,1,US,"March 09, 2023"
"Checking in was the breeziest. Thank you for your staff, especially Ramon in Oakland, California. Excellent staff and cars.",5,CY,"March 07, 2023"
This review refers to Fox Orlando.  Fox Orlando is not an on airport rental company.  They are  good 15 minutes away from Terminals A and B and more from Terminal C.  They do not facilitate the Florida visitor Sun Pass road toll system but instead charge $12.99 a day for their plate pass (maximum 15 days).  I verbally declined the excess insurance but it was added by the customer service agent but I did not notice this until I checked the rental agreement at our apartment.  Too late to do anything about it!  A reader might say I should have been more on the ball at the rental counter but one would hope the integrity of the agent could be relied upon and not be taken advantage of at the end of a long flight.So in summary: what looked a good deal when booking turned out not to be so.,1,US,"February 13, 2023"
"Great service, low daily fee and a nice newer Toyota Camry with low miles. Friendly and helpful staff- no hidden fees! No wait times at either pick up or drop off. We will use again!!",5,US,"March 06, 2023"
"Our reservation was placed in December for a rental SUV from Mar 4-11th in Denver.  When we arrived at our expected pick up time.  The wait at the airport was pretty lengthy as we had to wait for a 2nd shuttle bus because the first one could not accommodate our family of 5. When we arrived, our SUV was not available, and we were told we could wait an hour to see if the vehicle would arrive (but not guaranteed) or we could upgrade to the minivan for an extra $350 on top of the $416 we already paid.  We were stuck because we had prepaid the rental from Priceline, and we were traveling with 3 children with no other rental company next door.  I've never experienced this before in all the years I have rented vehicles on vacation.  Usually, we are given another vehicle of equal or better value due to ""overbooking"" on the company's end.  Anyhow, I struggled with the decision on what to do, and then another group came in with a similar situation with a really heated argument that took place.  I don't know if this is a common tactic for this company, but it's not a good look.  Finally, the manager (Marie) came back after dealing with the other party and dropped the upgrade fee to half.  It still was not ok with me to have to pay for any additional fee but reluctantly did so because we really had no other choice.  Then, during our trip, I found the previous renter's contract in the glove compartment.  They paid $292.88 for 8 days the prior week.  We paid almost double.  How is that for you?  So not fair.  Read the other reviews...same experience.  Never will I rent from this company again.",1,US,"March 04, 2023"

"It's Fox Rent-A-Car at LAX. What are you expecting? You are paying less money than pretty much every other Car Rental place. It's a good deal. We regularly rent cars from them. We know what to expect and have never had an issue with them. Yes, they try to upsell you and get you to buy insurance, prepay for gas, etc. Whatever. That's what these companies do! And it's helpful for some people. What blew us away on our most recent trip was when our 6 year old left a backpack in a rental car that we were thinking about choosing, but then we chose another vehicle. Several hours down the road, we realized that the backpack was missing - probably left in a different vehicle - with his tablet and other items that are very precious to a 6-year old boy.Assuming the worst, that someone had probably taken it, and had already pawned everything off, we still called Fox to see if they could check the other cars and see if by chance, the backpack was still there. I initially spoke with a person who was at a call center and unable to connect me directly to the LAX Fox, (which was annoying,) but she took my information and phone number down. Shortly after I got a call from the Fox LAX manager who told me that they went out and FOUND kiddo's backpack! And that they would hold onto it for when we returned. A week later, when we returned, we were handed the backpack with everything intact. Really appreciated them doing this for us! Saved the day and several hundred dollars for us. Did not expect anyone there to bother to help us out, but they came through! Thanks Fox!",5,US,"March 08, 2023"

Speed of the check in and attitude of everyone were came in contact from FOX.

"We always rent from fox. We are locals and it’s cheap and the customer service is better than other rental car companies. ZAHIR was awesome. He was very helpful and very pleasant. Every time we come to you guys the service is always good. The only suggestion that I have is that you all give the customers the option to pay for the actual rent a car with either debit or cash instead of having to pay with it using your credit card and that is because the interest rates on credit cards, these days are extremely high so if that could possibly be an option for people, I think that would be great.",5,US,"March 04, 2023"

"Pick-up went so smoothly we were on our way in far less time than I ever expected.  Drop-off was a NIGHTMARE, (not on your part!) but for us everything that could go wrong did.  From a traffic-jam to a health emergency NOTHING was going right.  When I called the Customer Service number the young man I spoke to was being SO helpful I almost cried!  He was able to extend our rental for 1-2 days at the same rate on our original agreement and we were greatly relieved.  We're home and safe now and definitely have and will tell our family and friends who travel out west frequently to use Fox because, for me you're the only game in town.",5,MX,"March 03, 2023"

"I received a very nice car. What I enjoyed most was the pick up. I rent a lot and normally out of Hartsfield International airport. Trying to get a reasonable price I used Budget or Thrifty but each time they overbooked creating a very long wait for a reserved vehicle. Fox provided a great car, great price and no hassle to pick it up. Highly recommend!",5,N/A,"March 06, 2023"
Clean car and great shuttle drivers. Know that when you take the tram from ONT to the rent a car place you need to then take a shuttle from there to the Fox rental. It took an extra 5 min but all that time was saved in the much shorter rental line.,5,US,"March 03, 2023"

I called 2 days in advance and was told it would be available for an additional 12-18 per day which was okay with me. In fact on arrival there was only one available car with navigation, it was a Chrysler 300.  To get that car cost me an extra $43 per day. I took it for my full 10 days so paid additional $430.  The only other option presented was to go ahead and cancel and hope to get a refund as it was fully pre-paid for and hope to get a car somewhere else.",2,US,"February 20, 2023"

"Fox is ""off airport."" If that bothers you, go elsewhere. But consider the money saved by taking a shuttle bus. It's a 15-minute bus drive from the airport. The cars are great condition. The service is excellent. Pick up and drop off are fast. Highly recommended... unless being ""off airport"" is a deal-breaker. There are three 7-Elevens and a WaWa right by Fox, and all have competitive gas prices. The van drivers really represented Orlando well, if that's your first and last impression of the city. Pick up process and staff were great, too. Quick and helpful.",5,US,"February 25, 2023"

"As an under 25 traveler, I was looking for a place that would be - as they say on their site - hassle free. It was not. Long story short, I was overcharged hundreds of dollars.Good things first: the person who helped me at the desk was very friendly. When the vehicle reserved for me was unavailable (more on that later), she was quick to give me options. When the second vehicle had problems, she was quick to offer a replacement. Once I was behind the wheel of the third and final vehicle, things went smoothly. The return was painless and quick.The bad things break down into a couple of categories. We'll start with car troubles. As mentioned above, the first vehicle, a Jeep Wrangler well suited for driving in the mountains right after a big snow, was for some reason unavailable (they blamed the flight delay throwing off my arrival time). When I pressed, I was told there was a 30 minute wait while they did some kind of work on it. Okay, long travel day, we just want to get home, so what else is there that we don't have to wait for? A small AWD SUV. Sure, good enough. Sign the paperwork, my group and I pile our stuff in, and we head out. On the road, I notice that the engine RPMs are consistently in the 4-6k range; the engine is complaining loudly once we hit anything above 45mph. Some 10 minutes out from Fox, we turn back.Also as mentioned above, they are quick to offer a replacement - but not before the manager asks to test the vehicle himself. I understood the need to verify but was also annoyed, because it felt as though he didn't trust me or anyone in my group to accurately report when an engine is nearly redlining trying to go from 50 to 55mph. When he got back from his test drive ""on an empty road out back"" (paraphrasing), he reported no issues. Cool, I still don't feel safe in that vehicle. What about the Jeep? It's been almost half an hour at this point, we'll just use that. Alas, the Jeep is now completely unavailable. With the benefit of hindsight, I suspect it was never available at all.We end up with a 4runner that is, quite honestly, just fine, though it struggled mightily going up in the mountains. The next category, additional charges, is why I will warn any and all drivers away from Fox, especially if they are under 25 or new to renting a vehicle like I was.The nice woman at the front desk was, again, nice. But she was also - to be diplomatic - misrepresenting the truth. The advance estimate for the total cost was about $530, but on the day, the cost was about $930. I'd understand a bit of fluctuation but not nearly double the initial estimate. This massive increase of course had me hesitate, but the nice woman at the front desk assured me that ""most"" of that increase was a security deposit that would be refunded upon vehicle return. A more experienced individual would have asked, at this point, why that substantial cost was not included in the initial estimate and have her point out where on the invoice that security deposit was listed. I failed to do either of those things, naively trusting the nice woman behind the desk because I was tired, stressed, and out of my element with three other people in my group waiting on me.$100 of the increase was from the underage fee. Heaven only knows why they don't include that in the estimate when they know the age of the driver in advance.When I finally noticed and balked at the added (supposedly optional) $130 insurance charge - I had my own insurance - she very nicely informed me that the optional insurance was required for underage renters. I pushed her on this, asked where in the agreement it was, and she deflected by saying it was a legal requirement. The car troubles and very long travel day distracted me enough that I failed to get that fun fact down in writing.There was no security deposit. There was, upon a reread of the policies listed in the email days after the fact, no optional insurance requirement for underage renters who had insurance of their own. Hundreds of dollars, gone, because I wasn't smart enough to see that I was getting played.",1,US,"January 18, 2023"

"We rented our car from the Fox location in Costa Mesa, CA.  Jackie was the agent who we worked with.  She has a wonderful personality: very friendly, professional and very helpful in providing directions.  When we returned our car three weeks later, we needed to order a LYFT car to bring us back to our residence. We could not access the internet on our phone, and the agent (not Jackie) told us that Fox did not provide WiFi--YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME, we said to the agent.  He shrugged his shoulders and said the company didn't provide it (Fox: get WiFi for your customers!) He offered no help. We then saw Jackie and went to her for help.  She was TERRIFIC!  She connected us to her personal phone's Hotspot so that we could access the LYFT app.  She did all this with a smile on her face--she sincerely wanted to help us.  We hope that Fox has an employee recognition program (if not, please develop one).  Jackie is the reason that we will use Fox again. She deserves to be recognized for her wonderful service. Any company would be proud to have Jackie as an employee.  Thank you for the opportunity to tell you about Jackie.",5,US,"February 28, 2023"
"Renting at Fort Lauderdale airport was horrible.  Bad enough that it took 1/2 hour when there were only 4 people were on line.  The car they gave me had a very big dent.  I wrote it down on the paperwork when I picked up the car.  Yet when I returned the car they argued that I was the one that caused the dent.  They totally ignored that I reported it when I picked up the car.  Fortunately I had pictures of the dent, showing the time and place of the picture.   Horrible renting experience.",1,US,"February 23, 2023"
"We found a vehicle with a little bit of side damage on it and we recorded it on the pre-ticket. When returning the vehicle we had missed a small portion of the damage on the pre-ticket and the gentleman reprimanded us for it although, it a obvious the damage was all from one incident. The incident prior to us picking up the vehicle.The way that he reprimanded us for not getting ALL of the damage was disheartening.We were tired when we arrived, we thought we recorded what we needed to, and then to have to anxiously await the receipt to see if we were charged for someone else's damage just added to our anxiety.Overall, the car was great!",4,US,"February 26, 2023"

Scam artists. Be aware. Declined additional insurance and in fact had to prove I had insurance. Told me I was signing to decline the insurance on a debit sized screen. 23 days after our rental we received an email copy of the agreement that looks nothing like what we signed. Shows an additional $200USD for insurance on a 1 week rental. No way to tell it wasn’t declined Fox sent us a form that was not the form we signed claiming we signed it. My business partners “prepaid fuel” also went from $3.30/gallon to $8.99/gallon on his forms. These guys are scam artists so be aware. Say they will refund the month in fox rental credit but I would never rent from them again with fear of this occurring again. They refunded 50% which is unacceptable as I spent 45 minutes trying to find my proof of insurance in a different company with 2 screaming kids after 21 hours of travel.,1,US,"February 12, 2023"

Return to airport was very quick.If you don’t drive the highways frequently with the rental, don’t pay $12/day for the tolls.  It’s only a couple of dollars to pa at the toll booth.",5,N/A,"February 17, 2023"

The car was older but ran well and there were no problems except the windshield washer fluid was empty.Be aware that cars need a Sun Pass to travel south Florida Turnpikes. We were surprised by this and paid $12 / day for the pass through Fox when it would have cost less than $10 for the tolls we received had we been able to pay them directly.",4,US,"February 18, 2023"

I left my cell phone along with the keys when I returned it a member of your team returned it to me when I was in the shuttle busappreciate that,4,US,"February 24, 2023"
The 20% to 30% savings makes the extra shuttle distance well worth it. This was my second Fox experience and I will rent from them again.  One tip: the Fox shuttle may not run if you arrive late at night; check their hours first.,5,US,"February 23, 2023"
terrific service and staff. also a very clean car!!! the rental price was fantastic!!!,5,CA,"February 15, 2023"
"Well-worth taking a shuttle to the off-airport location.  The staff were friendly, efficient, and low pressure.

"Pick up at Fox Rental San Diego, ( booking made initially with Europcar in the UK ) was initially pleasant. However this feeling quickly deteriorated since it was clear our receptionist was not going to be making any up-sales in added insurance, extra driver, you name it,  she tried it on....  even saying to us we could go elsewhere at one point. Slowly, (very slowly) she relented, as we stood our ground  calmy dismissing all the catastrophising situations that we 'might' need extra insurance for, none of which are/were necessary.This was an unpleasant and frankly unnecessary experience.Likely, as a result of the above, we were given a rather battered old Kia with some wear and tear already, 43000 miles on the clock and smelt of smoke...It was a clean as could be reasonably expected given its overall condition.I'd give no stars too if it were possible.I'd not recommend (Europcar or) Fox Rental, nor use them again",1,US,"February 06, 2023"
I would give them a 0 but 1 is the lowest option. I arrived at the Atlanta Airport to get my car which was reserved and paid for in advance through Expedia only to be told they were out of cars. If a rental is paid for in advance they should have to honor it or provide something comparable. Will never rent from Fox again (or from Expedia.),1,US,"February 26, 2023"
The staff at the location i visited was great the shuttle drive was a super sweet little lady. The front desk agent tami was from my hometown and made check out easy as ever.

Got to Dallas and they only had 2 minivans...that's it nothing else.  They where very nice about it though and let us just take the van at no additional cost. Got us in and out in about 10 minutes.

"The pickup and drop off were very quick which I appreciated during a vacation. We were given a nice car that was clean. During our trip however, the car had mechanical issues. The roadside pick up was helpful and ordered another car. It does take awhile, as I found out but the car was delivered. It was not as nice as the original. Upon our return home I sent an email to the company and they responded very quickly. A very nice woman in Orlando went above and beyond to make us whole again. I would truly use Fox Rent a Car in the future. These things can happen to even the best of companies, it's how you handle it. Thank you again!",5,US,"February 07, 2023"

At 11 PM, and they told me that I can wait until morning, maybe somebody will return car. I went to Avis, I found car, but i paid 3 times more, anyway I am happy with Avis, at least they had car.

First time renting with Fox, thank you.",5,US,"February 20, 2023"
"Was pleased with the rate and the car we received. Be aware though: they charge your $15 PER TOLL in Florida. Your other option is unlimited tolls for $12.99/day, but considering tolls are about $1 each, it’s a total rip off either way.",4,N/A,"February 10, 2023"

"I rented a 4WD Toyota from Fox at SLC, and had a great experience. Although I had to walk to the pick up area at SLC airport, it was right next to the on airport operators, and easily found. The shuttle arrived within 5 minutes, and the ride to the rental site was less than 10 minutes. All employees were super helpful, even bringing my rental car to the door. It was quite late in the evening (around 2100) and things were quiet, but great service. No problems with the car - perfect for our requirements, and virtually half the price of on airport competitors for an 8 day rental. On the way back, again super efficient, and I made use of an abandoned cart at the drop off site.A couple of things - I noted a lot of passengers waiting for the shuttle as I returned to the airport, and so you need to make sure you have enough time. I would add a minimum of 30 minutes to the collection and return processes to ensure that you are on time, over using an on airport provider - definitely worth it, if you are the one saving money!",5,US,"February 10, 2023"

Fox Rent a Car staff at SFO called me immediately and left a voicemail that I unfortunately didn't get until hours later when I realized I didn't have my suitcase.  I was able to retrieve it before they closed for the evening and they were so kind about it! 10 out of 10 would recommend Fox! I've had nothing but good experiences with Fox over the years.  I only wish they hadn't moved off site from SFO, but the shuttle is quick and frequent and I'm sure it helps them keep costs down that they seem to pass on to the consumer.

Friendly staff; competent. Very good price; car clean. Rental car building too far to walk from and to Terminal lugging 3 suitcases - no shuttles. Not Fox’s fault.,4,US,"February 15, 2023"
Great car selection and hastle free service!! I always use then when I visit Miami,5,US,"February 11, 2023"
"I had never rented a car on my own before and was a little nervous. Fox staff were friendly, efficient, and honest. We loved the car and they didn't try to get us to pick up a different size or model. Returning the car was easy and we had good directions on how to catch the shuttle to the airport. The experience was a great one and I would rent one again from them.",5,US,"February 07, 2023"

Service was handled smoothly both one check in and check out. The vehicle served our purpose well.,5,US,"January 21, 2023"
"The reservation process was quick and easy. The car ran great. The return process was also good. The shuttle good. I don't see much difference between Fox and any other Denver Airport car rental except the car, on the outside, was not as sparkly clean as others I have rented (the inside was very clean.) Also, the rental building was less spiffy, warehouse type, larger than others. But, the rate was really good and car rentals are crazy expensive these days. Just be sure to really check the cars for any damage, and report it to them, before you drive off (this is for all car rentals.) The car I got was certainly adequate and I would rent from Fox again without hesitation.",4,US,"February 08, 2023"

"Best price on a rental from PHX by far. Pickup was kind of painful, even though I was a member of the Fox Club, I had to wait in line while they tried to upsell everyone in front of me. I was allowed to pick between a couple of vehicles, which was nice.  All of the SUV’s that were available seemed kind of run down, higher mileage, but clean.",4,US,"February 04, 2023"

Everything was fast an efficient with the rental in SLC but the drop off and pick up location for the off site shuttle is a trek and airport carts are $6.00! If they could pick up at arrivals and drop and departures I'd give them 5 stars!,4,US,"February 11, 2023"

"BOOKING ID 46M7F9 @ Denver 2/16/22. Going skiing booked SUV, Chicago had a blizzard plain delayed 1 hr. Turns out no SUV available , at 7 pm so I was offered sedan or nothing. I still had 4 hr drive to mountains. 7pm on the airport not too many options available on holiday Weeknd. Had to squeeze kids and long skies after unpacking bags on the sidewalk. I was told they hold a car 1 hrs and I should call being delays on the plain?! I wasn't only one in line to be denied SUV. In front of me 2 other groups had the same experience being refused SUV. It was all happening, while we are  under nice advertisement with Toyta 4 runner saying how one can be upgraded to better experience. Who? Which one? I even didn’t want the upgrade I just wanted my regular experience with SUV. Shrewdness bothered me. They know upfront they what they going to do, thats why SUV rental is cheap. Probably few get it. And the rest of  you have sedan that is overpriced. They didn’t want to adjust the price because I was downgraded (though offered free tank of gas). This is first time I used other company then Enterprise. Before covid when enterprise didn’t have a car they would give free upgrade. If downgraded would always nicely adjusted a price. Fox has a name for a reason. Expedia refused to help, but send me back to FOX. Maybe one day Fox will meet a Wolf. Some tired pissed off  class action lawyer who will review their practices, and come with some round sum to compensated cheated customers.For now all you can do is vote with feet and money. Don’t go to FOX to rent a car , don’t pay FOX for renting.They should be off American car rental market.Very disappointed with Expedia. As a customer I feel cheated, lied, not served and expose to dangerous long drive through colorado mountains.",1,US,"February 16, 2023"

"I would not recommend using them.  They billed me for double the original invoice I signed at the counter.  I used the one at the airport in San Jose, Ca.  I returned the car half an hour early on the due date of 2/10.  They sent me an invoice on 2/13 showing  2/13 as my return date.  I called their billing department and they kept telling me I returned the car late.  They said no telephone number available at the counter for me to call and that they would have to send an email to them to confirm/ verify my actual return before they would give me a credit for the late fees and extra days.  They would not send me an email so that I would know who to follow up with or that someone was working on it but told me to call back in with any questions.  It's been crickets",1,US,"February 12, 2023"

Fox Rental had a very easy pick up and drop off. TTheir shuttle bus to and from the airport made things seamless as a traveler. The vehicle was what I expected and clean and there were no hidden fees upon arrival. I plan to use Fox again..for sure!,5,CA,"February 14, 2023"
I like the pick up and drop service of fox car rental,4,US,"February 13, 2023"
This is am off site rental company but don't let that sway you. The shuttle was there to pick us up and there to get us back to the airport with no waiting.  Super friendly shuttle drivers and easy check in and return.  We even got a free upgrade!  I would highly recommend this company for an easy and affordable rental,5,US,"February 06, 2023"
"It was a great experience, definitely will use them again! The car was good, unlimited milage and pick up, drop off was painless. Also the way that Ciara (desk) handled the situation when we erroneously brought a different card than the one we reserved the car with, was quick & efficient. She was not just efficient, she was also very professional but also very friendly & customer oriented. Kudos to her!! Great service & a great value for an incredible price 👍",5,US,"February 05, 2023"
From LAS airport to the car rental site was a little confusing as Fox was a completely different location and a second shuttle. There were no signs or instructions that clearly let us know we would be taking two shuttle services to get to the Fox car rental site. All of the other car rentals are together from the first shuttle ride. Luckily after walking around trying to find the Fox desk someone else was able to instruct us how to catch the second shuttle which does not go to the airport.,5,US,"February 13, 2023"

"Andrew, behind the counter was the highlight of our experience. He had such a great attitude and very friendly and nice! The systems were down as soon as we got in line so we waited in line for an hour and a half, then because they had to do everything manually, it took about a half an hour behind the counter. I know it was nobody’s fault, however with it taking two hours to rent the car it was extremely frustrating and exhausting when all you want to do after getting off an airplane is get to your destination. The car was fine and I would rent from Fox again as long as the systems are not down lol.",4,US,"February 09, 2023"

"Friendly staff from airport shuttle through pick up counter. No pressure to take unnecessary insurance as we were covered on our personal car policy. No surprises at all...other than nice ones. Got an unexpected upgrade from Toyota Corolla to 4 runner. Can be a challenge to park in congested Key West but we managed fine. Also, because Gremlins in your computer systems caused a delay at pick up, customers were offered a free tank of gas as a goodwill gesture. The delay was not a major inconvenience, but the free gas was a nice bonus! Bravo FOX for a pleasant experience in a jungle of sometimes predatory competitors. No nasty surprises, no bait and switch, just a nice experience.",5,US,"February 04, 2023"

"I purchased slw insurance and requested not to add the extra insurance coverage. I had prepaid everything online in advance, so would only need to add the sunpass when I collected car at Orlando.Upon returning the car I noticed on the receipt I had am extra 419 dollars on top of my original. Rental charge of 356 dollars .They charged me an extra insurance of 29 dollar per day I didnt ask for.Also they charged me for the original hire I paid two months in advance.Now not getting any reply from them.The car I booked was a dodge charger. They didnt have any so they offered me a dodge challenger, started to drive it and the bottom of the car was hanging off scraping on the ground.So they offered me another car a Chrysler 300s which was also battered rear bumper etc damaged and sensors for parking faulty, no Android auto for a 2022 model 🤷, I took the car as had been over an hour trying to get the car.I'm now trying to get a refund o the insurance I didn't ask for and the fact they charged me twice.I would not recommend them at all I've never been stung by a company for car hire, but it seems to be in USA they add all these hidden charges after the cost you think your paying. It literally doubles in cost..Will never use them again worst experience.When I handed the car ba",1,US,"February 11, 2023"

"Rental price was good and, frankly, more reasonable than other rental companies. Fox's flexibility with respect to extension of the lease was truly appreciated, as was the ability to contact a specific individual when I needed to extend -- so that I avoided the typical telephone wait times. Vehicle was clean and both rental and return was very easy. I have now joined Fox's rewards program and intend to rent through Fox for all future trips.",5,SG,"January 13, 2023"

"Update - just seeing our total bill was double what we we’re quoted. I don’t think anyone will help because I’m sure it’s common practice to have all of these extra fees - so I know the difference now and will be a little more educated next time I shop. From pick up to drop off, Fox exceeded every expectation. I can’t believe their prices (half) vs other agencies. We had a Mitsubishi Outlander Sport and the only option I wish it had was Apple CarPlay, so navigation was a nuisance not having hands free. That was my fault and I will specify next time we book with Fox. The customer service at pick up and drop off was excellent.",5,N/A,"February 09, 2023"

"After arriving at PHX and getting my bag, I exited the terminal as instructed in my Dec 23rd email. After waiting a while and not seeing the shuttle bus, I called the local phone number on my reservation. It connected me with the national reservation desk, instead, and the customer service agent said that the local office could not be contacted by phone (hmmm, why place it on the email, then?). The phone representative said that it could take 30 minutes if the bus was delayed. I was on the south curb outside Terminal 4 as instructed, and was told to wait. When the taxi dispatcher asked me if I wanted a taxi, and I explained my situation, he said to follow the signage to the rental car center via the sky train. Not knowing if Fox was a stand-alone facility or part of the center, I went ahead anyway. When I arrived, I was relieved to see the Fox Car Rental counter. I told my story to the manager, and she made sure that I left as an extremely satisfied customer.  The company dropped the ball - both with the email and instructions over the phone - but the office manager was wonderful! Because of her excellent customer service skills, I’m giving Fox Rental Car a 5-star rating.",5,CA,"January 24, 2023"

"ABSOLUTE FRAUD ON EVERY LEVEL!    AVOID THIS COMPANY!   Reserved an SUV thru Priceline.  Paid approx. $200 for 3 days in Seattle.  Upon pick-up, I was asked if I would like to take advantage of a service they provide for my convenience:  Since the fuel tank is full now and I am supposed to return it with the same, instead I can just drop off the vehicle, they will replace the missing fuel and charge me $4.46 a gallon.  I was told in the Seattle area the average price was around $5/gallon.   Sounds great, right????   Don't have to stop at a gas station before returning the car and save a few dollars as well.  I ended up driving fewer miles than expected and returned the vehicle with the tank still 7/8 full.  Upon returning home, I found out that Fox charged me an additional $252 dollars, including $90 for an upgrade I didn't ask for and $102.58 for fuel.  I did the math:  $102.58 divided by $4.46 per gallon comes to 23 gallons.  The Toyota 4runner I had holds exactly 23 gallons of fuel.  So they charged me as if I returned the SUV without a drop of fuel in it.  Naturally, I called customer service.  Someone in the Philippines answered the phone and I could hear farm animals in the background.   Never a great sign!   They proceeded to tell me that I did in fact return the car with 7/8 full of gas, but unfortunately, nothing could be done since I signed a contract stating I would pay $102.58 for gas.  I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told someone would call within 24-48 hours. Of course, no one did.   I tried to call the Fox rental desk at Seattle airport directly.   BEWARE!!!  Any automated option you choose will end up being answered by someone in the Philippines.  I even tried to dispute the credit card transaction thru my bank to see if I could get the fraudulent charges returned.  The result was the same:  Too bad, the contract has your signature.   I hope some day there will be a class action lawsuit against this company.  If so, I am 100% on board!",1,US,"December 10, 2022"
"Fox Rent a Car changed in a great way. The acquisition by Europcar has taken FOX from a small offering on Century Blvd to a major company approach with great vehicles and great prices for people arriving at LAX.  When you search Los Angeles rental cars on the web, the first listings are usually much cheaper.  These rental offerings are usually made by fly-by-night rental shops close to the airport on Century Blvd. After waiting for shuttles that seldom arrive, after calling customer service numbers that send you to an agent on another planet who just tell you, “the shuttle is on the way” you finally get to the off-site location and then dragged through small print that usually traps you into additional charges or just makes your life miserable as you try to get the vehicle you were promised, an experience where you WISH you had paid more for another rental carrier.  FOX IS DIFFERENT, Fox has lots of nice vehicles of every type, they really do.  Sometimes the wait at the counter has been a tiny bit long, but overall, the people are very nice, and you really get a great deal and are treated like you are working with a major rental car company at a bargain rate who VALUES your business.  Hopefully, Europcar keeps up the great work and Fox continues to grow, as long as the folks are nice, I’ll keep coming back – thanks!",4,CA,"February 10, 2023"

She has a USA passport, UK driving license and proper credit card. We've rented >75 times over >25 years. We've never been asked for - let alone heard of - an ""International Driving Permit"". Never, not once. The IDP translates local driving licenses into multiple languages such as English.  Her UK driving license was already in English.

Seemed shady at first but when we got there and through everything it went great.  They want to sell you extra insurance which i declined. Unnecessary when I have a large policy through my personal policies.,5,US,"January 29, 2023"
"Nice car and easy pickup.Legendary Jay from the Bay took excellent care with each of his customers, including us!

It was fast and straight forward if you have a reservation. Strongly encourage people to have reservations before showing up.,4,US,"January 27, 2023"
"Even though it's off site, it probably only added 15 to 20 minutes more. The price value was better than many others in the airport. I still think there is a bit of frustration with suggested add ons but all car rental companies are guilty of that. We switched vehicles from the original reservation and it saved alot in gas costs. Our agent Ben was friendly and very patient.",5,US,"January 31, 2023"
"Great experience will rent from Fox again.  I usually use another brand that has gone downhill since being aquired.  Happy to have found a car rental agency with great service, great prices, and great cars.",5,N/A,"January 30, 2023"
The staff is really what made the experience great.  I made a mistake on my reservation and Trisha at the customer service desk fixed the problem and made sure we got the car with any delays.  Zach was working in the garage and made sure we got in the nicest car and help with all of our luggage.  Everyone at Fox was super professional and there to make our experience 5 STAR.,5,US,"February 02, 2023"

"Absolute scam company! Hidden costs that weren’t disclosed and then charged to credit card later without explanation or agreement, a £600 rent a car ends up costing £1400. Misleading to advertise prices if that isn’t the real cost, also site is not on airport as advertised, has left me with a credit card bill I can’t afford to pay",1,US,"December 17, 2022"
Very poor customer service. The front desk girl “Chassie” was extremely rude and refused to rent me a car even though I had already paid for the car rental. I had to take the shuttle back to hobby airport and rent from National who matched Fox’s price. Don’t rent from Fox Car Rental. They don’t care about their customers.,1,US,"February 05, 2023"
Efficiently handled my fender bender.,4,US,"January 31, 2023"
"Onsite staff is as helpful as possible.  However many of the vehicles are older with high miles and in pretty tough condition (ours had 80k+ miles and a battery that struggled to start the car every day).  Also be sure you understand Fox's definition of e.g. an SUV vs. general understanding of that term as we reserved an SUV to transport skis and equipment into the mountains and the tiny car that Fox defined as an SUV never would have worked, it was one of the smallest cars I've ever seen.  Inspect the car very carefully including windshield wiper functionality and windshield chips before taking the vehicle.  Fox is not flexible in advance if e.g. you need to change your reservation to pick it up at a different time. You'd have to cancel and reschedule at a new rate, even if just changing by a couple hours.  However onsite, in person staff can help extend the reservation on the back end if they have availability.",3,AU,"January 29, 2023"
"The pricing the Fox initially quote is deceptive. They have so many hidden costsThe car that we hired was very poor. No working air conditioning. We paid to hire a child seat, the buckle and strap was missing",1,CA,"January 15, 2023"
the customer service at the Fox in Fort Myers is outstanding !,5,US,"February 03, 2023"
"I had a great experience renting with Fox @ John Wayne Airport in Orange County (SNA).  I rented directly through the Fox website and got a fantastic rate - easily 1/3 of the competitor's prices.  I was a little worried about being haggled with up-selling at pickup, but no such thing happened!  I did double-check with my personal insurance to make sure I'd be covered in case of an accident, and printed out all my documents so I was prepared.  The vehicle provided was a lot larger than expected (I reserved a compact SUV and received a huge Toyota 4Runner) - but I would much prefer this than the other way around.  I ended up really enjoying the Toyota!  Customer service was excellent from start to finish; even the shuttle driver was friendly and the shuttle was a clean, elite Suburban.  Thanks Fox!",5,N/A,"January 21, 2023"
Good experience with a clean well equipped Toyota Corolla.,5,US,"February 01, 2023"

"Booked a rental in Burbank through Expedia for fox car rental, paid for it, was told 148 would be due at pickup. Finally found the little booth they were in and got help after standing there for 10 minutes with no one in front of me. This was a business trip. They had me give them a credit card other than the one I used online, charged me 60 dollars for being 45 minutes early. gave me a sedan Instead of an suv like I reserved. They charged me $320 dollars on top of the 184 dollars I paid through expedia. Bunch of other charges I didnt know what they were. Classic bait and switch. HORRIBLE customer service, will not reply to emails or messages. AVOID THIS SCAM COMPANY.",1,SR,"January 23, 2023"
"Your Pickup & dropoff services are EXCELLENT. Car quality needs to be improved before pickup, that is, a cleaner and a properly serviced vehicle.",4,BR,"January 27, 2023"
"When we arrived at the airport and went to pick up the car, Fox charged not only the balance we'd have to pay, but what we have paid in advance at the moment of the reservation at Wisecars.So, instead of paying 650,99 usd, we payed 1291,56 usd for the car.Even showing the reservation number and papers, the attendant said we could only have the car if all amount was paid. She ignored everything we said.",1,US,"December 21, 2022"
"Amy, Lisa and Tori are awesome and always do a good job",5,US,"January 23, 2023"

"Twice in a row the San Diego Fox Rental Car location either ""did not have"" or cancelled my reservation with no notice. The first time they said they just did not have it and blamed it on Priceline, who verified they sent the reservation, and even re-confirmed while I was there waiting. The next time I booked directly with Fox and for some reason nobody could explain to me why they cancelled it with no notice. I was renting a minivan for my family and they told me they didn't have any minivans available but I could have a huge SUV for more than double the price. I told them I did not want a huge SUV and would go elsewhere to find a van. Two minutes later they magically had 6 or 7 minivans to choose from but at a 50% higher cost than my reservation. Since it was almost 11 PM and my wife and 14 month old were waiting, I took what I could get. Lastly, they told me I didn't need to fill up the tank when I returned the vehicle and that gas would be billed at $4.40/gallon. When I got my bill they charged me $8.99/gallon, more than double what was stated by the rep. I will NEVER be using them again and I suggest anyone else traveling to San Diego look elsewhere to avoid their bait and switch tactics.",1,US,"January 18, 2023"
"Overall was good.  The car was dirty and the basic model of the car.  It was pretty beat up.  Front headlight was out, the key fob didn't work and alot of scatches and dings.  But great price and the customers service was good.",4,US,"January 28, 2023"
Great staff nice .Good price .,5,US,"January 26, 2023"
The car was decent for a rental. The shuttles were quick and drivers courteous. The clerk at the counter was trained well to get people to purchase their toll package. We asked multiple times about other options and his response was always that tolls were cashless so we had to purchase Fox’s almost $200 plan (“or take our chances avoiding toll roads with longer drive times”). Afterwards we found out that Walgreens and many other retailers sell sunpass transponders for almost and eighth of that price. Lesson learned,4,US,"January 17, 2023"
"Speedy pick-up and drop-off at the Phoenix location. Would have been nice to receive a clean (exterior) car though, especially the windshield.",4,US,"January 22, 2023"
"Got the typical bate & switch.  Had even called to confirm a Hyundai Santa Fe was available as wanted to test drive this model after getting it last year from FOX in Ft Lauderdale and was happy with it.  But was offered only a Dodge Journey which is NOT EQUIVALENT as these vehicles don't have the necessary leg room as does the Santa Fe...why even classify as same?  So the typical response was ""we can upgrade you""...OF COURSE...IT'LL COST YOU!!!  WHY???? I was promised it and why I PREPAID!!!! WHAT a typical SCAM!!!   The vehicle I was given was NOT AN UPGRADE....it was the typical Jap tin can!!...a sub-standard Toyota 4Runner...no featured equipment features like the normal Hyundai Santa Fe and drove and handled TERRIBLE!!!  It even was reporting tire issues CONSTANTLY...but all tires fine...didn't even have way to test tire inflation pressure like most GMCs have...again substandard.  Why if FOX didn't have the promised vehicle...upgrade at THEIR EXPENSE?  And if I pay almost double the daily rate I was promised...TRULY upgrade to a vehicle with same features as promised...not these sub-standard Toyotas, but at least a GMC equivalent?  It'll be my last rental from FOX!!  I had to put up with this crap vehicle for 3weeks!! FOX knew I was coming nearly 3 months ahead and prepaid as well...I would had expected FOX to ensure that the vehicle promised WAS AVAILABLE and reserved...especially having been a repeat /returning customer.   Oh and by-the-way...STOP encouraging buying the toll road SunPass @ $10 a day...the desk clerk said oh you'll need it!!...BS!!! Drove nearly 1000 miles and NEVER NEEDED IT.  Went to Ft Lauderdale, New Smyrna Beach, St Augustine and back through Orlando without it!!  What another SCAM avoided!!  I would think FOX would be able to stand up to your promises and if not eat the cost at their expense to keep your customer satisfaction level up.In reply to Fox reply...yes I talked with the Orlando office and they said they'd have one.",1,N/A,"January 04, 2023"

"I rented a vehicle (Nissan Altima) from Fox. I was told to bring the car back empty (as in no gas in the tank) and prepay a full tank of gas because their gas rates are cheaper.  I informed the lady I was not driving that many miles and would not be able to use all the gas in it, and would bring it back full, and she said, why do that, our rates are cheaper and we will only charge you for what you use.  That was a LIE!!  I only used a quarter of a tank, and upon return, I got a $47.54 charge on my credit card.  They informed me that I prepaid for a half tank of gas, and I said I only used a quarter tank, and all they could say was, this is a valid charge, Sir.  There was also a separate charge for $18.86 for an ""early return"".  The car had to be returned by 12pm, and I returned it at 9:30AM that morning.  Does that really warrant an early return charge?  Seriously??  Clearly, this is a nickel and dime operation that chooses to rip off their customers (and be dishonest with them) in order to add a few more bucks to their bottom line.  Very dishonorable  and they lack integrity as a Company.  Do not trust these people.  I will never use them again, and will not recommend them to anyone. After submitting this review, Fox did reach out to me and was able to resolve my complaint and refund the extra charges.",2,US,"January 15, 2023"

"I can't say enough.  We missed our flight and needed to quickly get another car rental for the day.  (Pheonix airport)I checked several companies and thier rates were unreasonable.....I believe because theu knew we were desperate.To be honest I almost didn't go to FOXA because thier reviews weren't the greatest.But I am so Tha kful that I did The gentleman at the counter was genuinely sympathetic to our situation.  He didn't have many cars available but manged to get us one that he did have on his lot, that would have normally been very expensive.He was able to get us a great price on it to help us out.The car (a charger) was brand new.The pick up and drop off staff was quick and friendly.All staff thanked us for choosing FOXI recommend your company very highly, and I'm a picky person.",5,US,"January 20, 2023"
Don't book through Travelocity - book with Fox Rent a Car directly! The customer service is excellent!!Didn't get the car that we had requested but they had something available that worked for us and got us on our way.Depending on time of day you may have to check in at the parking garage-just a little intimidating finding your way around the airport. Now that I know where to find them its easy.,4,US,"January 19, 2023"

"We have been scammed by Europcar by Keddy (also under the name Fox Rentals) at the Cancun airport .  We arrived at the airport and after 1 hour no shuttle arrived for us.  The telephone at the rental car company did not answer the phone. The Europcar desk told us to wait outside for a shuttle. After 1 hour we re-enter the airport to find a man at the desk Europcar desk whom calls us a shuttle which arrives with a Europcar and Fox rental logo.  This shuttle takes us to a trailer with a Fox Rental logo on the representatives shirts.  After waiting in a parking area we enter the trailer. The Fox rental representative immediately refuses our rentalcover insurance booked with booking.com as they say it does not work in Mexico. They then tell us to show them our American Express (AMEX)  proof of insurance. I sent the document to the email provided by the representative after calling American Express long distance 20 minute phone call .  They ask me to sign electronically on an iPad and ask for my credit card American Express.  I sign and give them my credit card.  They tell me I must leave a 9.000 Dollar security deposit.   Then they told me the mexican law requires a licence fee of 140,00  dollars.  Then the manager comes  and informs me that  the American express insurance is not accepted in Mexico (contrary of the 1st representative).  He also tells me I must cancel the rental cover insurance as it is not valid.My husband contacts rental cover.com whom tells us this information is not true.  We look up this Fox rentals on the internet and discover they are a scam.   We were in the office for a total of 2 hours . Plus 1.5 hours waiting for a shuttle.  We left the trailer office with no car.  The representatives were very unprofessional and aggressive.   We walked out and went to Carflex next door whom told us it is not true concerning the fees.   They wasted our time for 3 hours and wasted our money on long distance calls to Booking, rental cover and American Express (over 100 Euros of charges)    We spend over 100 Euros of long distance phone calls to American express, rentalcover and booking.com.  It was an awful experience.  The outside of the trailer was full of people in the same situation.",1,US,"January 08, 2023"

"Worst place ever. Since my flight was late, they gave my car to someone else and made me upgrade to a more expensive one. As soon as the flight got delayed I called them and they promised to keep my car till my flight arrives. But they gave it to someone else. On top of what I paid through Expedia, they changed me for another whole rental. When I contact customer service, they didn't help at all. Go with a legitimate car rental company.

"We arrived at Jacksonville Airport quite late. Though I wasn't aware when I reserved a car rental through Priceline that the Fox Car Rental was not at the airport but required a shuttle, another competitor let me know when I looked for it. She also advised that the shuttle might not run past midnight, so before we picked up our luggage, I walked out to where the shuttle was located and told the driver we had just arrived and could she wait while retrieved our bags. She assured us she would and she did. She loaded our bags after we came back and drove us to the Fox location a short distance from the airport. We were greeted there and quickly went through the process to get the car then drove to our hotel.... that we passed on the way which was great since we were not familiar with the area or its location either.  The car was sufficient for our needs and the return process was easy a week later. The shuttle rode back to the airport was easy as well and again appreciated that the driver loaded and unloaded our bags. All in all a great experience.",5,US,"December 30, 2022"

"Arrived on time ,with all the correct documentation at the Fox Rental Desk at Chicago airport to collect my rental vehicle, however was informed by Shahidah that they did not allow the vehicle to be taken into the adjoining state of Michigan and therefore would not provide us with a vehicle, she stated that we should contact Wisecars, who we had placed the booking with, about an alternate rental provider or a refund.Unfortunately we were left stranded at the airport and had no choice but to pay for a taxi to our accommodation .I emailed Wisecars that day and they said they where’s very sorry for this situation and would investigate this with yourselves and to let them know if I required a refund . I informed them that their reply was urgent as I needed a rental vehicle the following day, I did not hear from them so I requested a full refund of £842.98 which I paid in full to them 3 months early and then had to find another rental vehicle myself. I have continued to chase my refund from them, they said the delay was initially because Fox was not replying to them , however that is now over 4 months ago and still have not got my £ 842.98 refunded 😩😩Thanks to Fox Rental, however their statements are not correct, I never received any information regarding the rental policies from Wisecars when I booked and paid in full on the 5 June 2022. Approximately 24 hours before I began my journey on the 17 August 2022, I was notified by Wisecars for the first time that the rental vehicle was to be provided by Fox. My attention was not brought to any specific restrictions, such as the not being able to take the vehicle into the next state of Michigan!! I feel I sure been may aware of this under the UCTA ( unfair contract terms act) also over a number of years I have rented vehicles all across the US and never call across such a restriction. I would like Fox to confirm if they retained any of my payment for the vehicle they would not provide, this will unable me to pursue the responsible party for my refund ?",1,CR,"August 18, 2022"

"DO NOT RENT FROM THIS AGENCY. I had a terrible experience renting from Fox, also referred to as Europcar. The information in my reservation said a shuttle would be available to and from the Orlando, FL airport from and to the car park; however, when we arrived to return the car, the rental office and lot were closed and we had to leave the car parked literally outside on the street, leave the keys with a security guard and hire our own transportation to the airport. This all caused a delay, terrible stress as well as an extra expenditure. Several other customers found themselves in the same difficulty. It was all very upsetting. Apart from that, I stated I did not want any extra coverage and only wanted what I had already paid for, the agent said there was nothing extra and had me sign on a screen the agreement. Upon receiving my receipt, it turns out I was charged for extras that were not clearly stated as extras. The cost of the rental may appear to be cheaper than in other agencies, but in the end it turns out more expensive with the “sneaky” extras and it’s not worth it if you’re left stranded without a way of getting to the airport. Go for the more known and reliable companies.",1,US,"December 31, 2022"
"Great agents on the desk at Sea-Tac! Recommended an upgrade (normally I wouldn't do it) that turned out to be the best decision on our trip. We had snow, ice, rain and freezing rain - but the agent's recommendation of a front-wheel drive car kept us safe and sane on this family vacay!",5,US,"December 20, 2022"
We were in a bind and Fox came through. The added benefit was the EXCELLENT customer service! The rep was really patient and truly wanted to help people. They brought the car up for us and had it warming so that we would be warm when we got in. I would absolutely rent from them again in the future. THANK YOU!!!,5,US,"December 24, 2022"
"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANYI lost out on $500 because I didn't have a credit card (a lot of Europeans don't use credit cards). Was only notified at the counter, after pre-paying over $500, that they would be unable fulfil my reservation due to lack of credit card. Not only  that, they were unable to refund my pre-paid deposit. The lady the was checking in at the other counter was being scammed with hidden fees and extra charges. The whole company is an absolute sham and full of crooks.I ended up having to call a friend to come pick me up and we went to Enterprise where I rented a car, last minute, and were extremely helpful with working out a deal. SHAME ON YOU FOX RENT A CAR! YOUR BUSINESS ETHICS ARE ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL.",1,US,"December 28, 2022"

"Rented from Las Vegas airport. Bit of a travel as you take two shuttle buses to get to the rental but no matter which rental company it's at least 1 shuttle. No issues at rental, customer support was good at front counter. No issues with vehicle.",4,US,"December 15, 2022"
"As this was the first time using FOX (I normally rent from the bigger, more mainstream rental brands), I paid close attention to the process and nuances.  First of all, the line at FOX was far shorter than the other car rental counters at the Phoenix airport.  This is perhaps likely due to Fox not marketing their cars on the big discount sites like Hotwire, etc.  (perhaps that helps them keep costs down in order to offer lower costs rentals).  The rental process was quick and the only small frustration was the $12+ fee for an extra driver (my wife).  I understand that rental car companies need to make money, but fees like this seem completely excessive and unnecessary (**if the renter (or his / her insurance) pays for damage to the car no matter what, how can a rental agency justify an extra driver fee other than to simply extract more money from the renter?  how does an extra driver incur more costs to the rental agency?).   The representative (Trish) was very nice and just was doing her job - I understand this.  But, it does seem obvious that the agents are given incentives to upsell / cross sell additional fees to every customer, which is annoying). To offset the extra driver fee, she offered a car upgrade to a 4Runner, which softened the blow to some extent but the $300 or so more for the 'added driver' definitely soured the process.  Downstairs, we were greeted by Breann Sellers who helped us find our vehicle. She was LOVELY and a pleasure (and made getting the car very pleasant).  A couple other observations:  we rented the car for 25 days and decided to return the car early (after 15 days).  Upon reading the rental agreement and searching online, it was very unclear what Fox's 'early return' policy was.  I finally reached somebody at billing who was confused and could hardly explain the policy to me (it sounded like a Filipino call center with somebody hardly fluent in the rental car process).  This was baffling to me since early returns seem like a VERY common practice for rental car companies.  After trying to interpret the billing representative's explanation of the early return policy, I decided to attempt to return the car early figuring that I'd keep the car if the return fee was onerous.  Upon returning the car, the representative (ALI, who was very nice) explained that I'd need to go to the check-in counter upstairs to discuss the early return fees / policy and that he could only charge the auto-fee / daily rate penalty (which I didn't know about and that the billing department could not explain clearly).  Thankfully, I had time to go upstairs, wait in the short line and discuss the early return matter (as it paid off).  The manager, Joelle, was so nice and thoughtful and made the manual / override adjustments to the billing to prorate my rental agreement (paying for the days I had the car, waiving the penalties).  Joelle - thank you so much for the kind help and objectivity regarding the circumstances.  She and her team at the Phoenix airport were excellent.  We were happy to pay for the car and expected that returning a car early would not incur expensive penalties.  Summary:  I've rented cars dozens of times and, after finding Fox, would certainly rent again, with some caveats.  Pros:  short lines, nice people, low costs, decent car options -- Cons:  unclear and unusual policies and possible excessive penalties and add-ons (not standard car rental policies) that can turn what is supposed to be a discount provider into an expensive option.  Just be sure you read the fine print and ask questions.  I hope this is helpful!",5,US,"December 11, 2022"

"While the staff was awesome, check in was very fast, and our van was very nice, the one thing that knocked a star off was the double shuttle riding.  From the airport you take one shuttle to another area that you then wait in another line to get to the rental area.  Since it's the beginning of a trip, we didn't mind that.  The return trip of doing the Fox shuttle to the airport shuttle became very stressful when there was now huge lines to try and catch a bus to the airport (this was at 4:30 am).  A direct shuttle would have been a lot less stressful.  Overall, knowing ahead of time that it could take 40 mins to get to the Vegas airport (even though you are only a few miles from it) should help others plan accordingly.  Overall we would still rent from Fox, as the rest of the experience was wonderful.",4,US,"December 18, 2022"
I am concerned after reading a lot of bad reviews about Fox Rental. However my experience is great. I waited less than 5 minutes to ride on a shuttle bus; did not get any hassles in service desk; the car is very nice although has high mileage. The final charge is identical to the original charge.,4,US,"December 21, 2022"
Don't ever rent from this company. Was charged 60.00 administrative fees for 5.05 worth of tolls. These fees were not disclosed at signing but were said to be buried in the fine print. Regarding the company's response. I was offered to pay 11.99 per day or just pay the tolls once they came in. There was not one word said about the administration fees.   Just look at all the negative reviews this company is getting. While we are at it The first car I was given pulled to the right tremendously so I took it back. The front left tire was low on air and then it was discovered the left tire was bald so they put me in a different vehicle. The employee that checked the cars in was very polite but this company is a sham,1,US,"December 01, 2022"

Used Fox in Las Vegas and had a great experience. Originally we reserved a car with another major car rental company for $560 for 9 days. Checking prices I discovered Fox and rented a brand new Toyota for $232 for the 9 days we spent in Las Vegas. I thought it was too good to be true but it wasn't. Pickup and drop off were a breeze. No hitches. Thanks Fox!,5,US,"December 18, 2022"

"I don't understand why my credit card was charged for a $150 + the full amount estimated for the rental i.e. $198.  My credit card was charged for $348 as a DEPOSIT.  IT'S NOT A DEPOSIT IT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE RENTAL IS CHARGED AND A DEPOSIT IS ADDED TO THAT!!  In the past $150 was charged as a deposit---I get that--but since when was the full amount + deposit charged?  A deposit is supposed to be a partial payment toward the full amount owed AT A LATER DATE.  I know the deposit is refunded but, by charging $198 on my card, it was in essence a pre-payment.  I could not use that $198 for other purchases.  If Fox requires pre-payment of the rental, so be it.  But don't call it a deposit.",4,US,"December 10, 2022"

"I just want to say I had an amazing experience at the Houston (Hobby Airport) location this passed weekend. From the beginning, Chaniecya took really good care of me during my checked-in.

Very patient and understanding. Also, Quiarra was another employee who brightened my day when I came to return  the car back.,She asked me about my trip and what all I enjoyed about being in the city of Houston. She really made me feel like I valuable customer; this was just my first time. I definitely will rent from this location again. In addition, I don’t remember my bus driver name but the light-skinned bald head dude is a keeper and will make your ride to airport  feel so much at ease.

"DO NOT USE FOX. 1) Pick up location is off site. Unpleasant shuttle drivers. Dirty vehicles. 2) Takes too long to get the car. Most of the card readers are broken.

Joseph at rental center lied to me stating that he guaranteed that Fox had the best gas prices...Fox was $0.30 more expensive. 5) Lots mysterious ""Taxes"" and ""surcharges"" that customer service cannot explain.

"I would NEVER recommend anyone to rent a car via Fox Rent a Car at Miami airport, or, as in our case, via what we thought would be a safe, non bluffing company,  Europcar, on booking.com, which is aperently is delivered by shady Fox. Especially if you are foreign, seems to be their favourite victims even if my english is fairly good. Here is our story and my reasons I recommend you to to choose any other company instead of Fox:1. We booked a car with place for 3 suitcases in the back (according to the website). Arriving at Fox garage the lady who helps us says they don't have that typ of a car in, but shows us another car she says is the same size, which after reading about the different models is NOT. There is no way for us to fit our two toddlers and our bags safely in the car she shows us and she offers us to upgrade to a bigger one, we have no choice to say other than yes. should cost us +580 USD.1""tollpass is included in your booking so you just drive past the tolls ok?"" sure thing! Both me and my husband were happy because usually renting in the US that is a question(!) of upgrade while picking up the car. But..Afterwords she charged us for it. Now looking at the reciept it do say 11.56USD/day but when she said its INCLUDED IN THE BOOKING the tired, jetlagged mom with two crying kids did not reflect more on that. I guess the lady at the counter notice my state of mind and saw her shot to make some more money, both with the toll pass and the upgrade. 3. We rented a GPS. the GPS did not come with any kind of holder and I need to try to drive with it in my lap. But it did not really matter because we notice quick it did not work. ""Connection lost. searching...."" It sent us on so many detours because it could not keep up with the highway and where to get of so we stoped using it after a day or two and used our phones (with roaming) instead. ""it should be working"" was the only thing the guy said at return when I wanted my money back. So DO NOT rent via Fox in Miami or Europcar via Booking.com in Miami, and IF you do. make sure you read all three pages because what the people working at Fox says and what is written is not always the same.",1,US,"December 02, 2022"

"Was my first time renting from Fox in Salt lake city, Utah and had an amazing sales rep named Ana who made our first time experience so incredibly easy.

I emailed the company they said the same thing. I feel like if they have not trained their employees the right way is NOT my fault you can’t tell someone one thing and then do something else when it’s a company……. What kind of customer service is this? What kind of company don’t try to satisfy their customers? If the agent would have said it’s nothing they could do I would have did something different and then to charge me 1 whole day for one hour is just not fair. DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY. I rent cars all the time from other companies and have NEVER been treated like this and NEVER experienced a problem like this. I will never use this company again. Please be aware of this company.",1,FR,"November 22, 2022"

"LAX - 2022 Toyota 4Runner in excellent condition. Pick up from airport is slow, we waited for 30 minutes. Location is excellent. No lines at the counter.  Security deposit is required. Cost is very reasonable compared to others.",4,CA,"November 16, 2022"
Shuttle was for pick up was not good experience as our flight was delayed and it was midnight when trying to get it. Car was tired and older but for price fine and worked without issue. Drop off was smooth and shuttle prompt. Overall experience was good!,4,US,"November 19, 2022"
"When I picked up the car I asked if since I had American Express if I was already covered by insurance but they said they didn't know and said I could just get insurance and call customer care if I wanted to cancel the insurance.  When I found out I actually was already covered with my AmEx card, I called customer care, but they wouldn't let me cancel the insurance on the car over the phone and demanded I drive 3 hours to be able to cancel the insurance in person.  Then when I returned the car and asked for an explanation and refund they were rude to me. I will never use Fox ever again!",1,US,"November 16, 2022"
"we had to change our reservation from one airport to another but had booked with a 3rd party and pre-paid. This was problematic but the Fox agents who helped were professional, friendly and knowledgeable. It made a huge difference to the start of our family vacation!",5,US,"December 01, 2022"
Great service and nice car at a fair price!,5,US,"November 24, 2022"
Fast transaction. Transportation to and from airport is fast,5,US,"November 25, 2022"
Great Rental Car Company. Thumbs up,5,US,"December 01, 2022"
Fox is easiest rental agency to work with.  Angel is awesome helping navigate best options!,5,US,"November 28, 2022"
Vehicle was very clean and the most affordable compared to the competition,5,US,"November 20, 2022"
Fox team member Kalki was very helpful in renting our AWD SUV. She is friendly and full of knowledge about the vehicles. Very happy with my experience and rental car from Fox which started with her.,5,US,"November 18, 2022"

"I had a car reservation at Sky Harbor this past March through a travel website for about $550.  I mistakenly put the reservation in my wife's name.  When I got there, Fox refused to switch the reservation to my name or book me at the $550 rate.  They offered to book me at $2,500.  Okay, that is their prerogative and I made a mistake in the booking.  However, they could have earned my unending loyalty by giving me a booking in my name at the rate of the original reservation of $550.  This tells me that Fox is more interested in short-term gain then in building customer loyalty.  That is their right.  It is my right to walk, as I did (over to another rental agency).    I will never book with Fox again.  When they had an opportunity to help me or stick it to me they chose the latter. Fox, you are one and done",1,US,"March 17, 2022"
Check out in Austin TX was good! Even with 2 people ahead of me I had keys in 15 minutes.,5,US,"November 16, 2022"
"I will not recommended. I was rental car in Cancun, Mexico. The time to just get the car is take longer than an hour, the price is not bad at the first but when we’re returned the car was got extra charge for $185 for just special wash because the car have a Tarr when we drove on the construction road and actually that car already have that issue on the same passenger side prior to our rental. For that amount of extra charge is unexceptable. Beware to get rip off.",1,US,"November 25, 2022"
"Our rental experience was great overall, wouldn't change anything. The cars were very affordable and exactly what we were expecting. The people working at the counter were also very kind and helpful.

"From the time I checked in to pick up my rental car the customer service was excellent at the Phoenix location. Given the customer service was good at the Orange County CA location when I rented from them twice, but they didn't go out of their way to accommodate my needs and also was going to charge me an early return fee when I was told on the phone that would not take place. So I have to say the Phoenix office really beats the OC office with their customer service. Keep up the great customer service Phoenix, AZ office it was a pleasure doing business with your office.",5,US,"November 19, 2022"
"Excellent experience. Rental cars are very competitive. I honestly thought Fox stood out from the rest and the service was excellent. The staff was calm, patient and respectful. The service was fast and reliable. Great job!",5,US,"November 19, 2022"
I was concerned at first because I never heard of Fox rental car. I was a little disappointed at Orlando international airport that there weren’t more signs for where to catch the shuttle bus to go off site to pick up your car. I also didn’t know it was a few minutes drive from the airport. Once we got to the car rental place it was smooth sailing. Our clerk was fabulous. We were the last flight in before the airport and rental place closed for our Hurricane Nicole. she upgraded our car to a SUV for free which was great because there was so much rain.  we were out before the storm hit Orlando. The return was even easier. So glad I did the tank of gas and return on empty. Also handy was the Plate Pass in FL.,5,CA,"November 09, 2022"
"From contacting Fox directly, to Pickup to Return, it was a great experience.  A+++.  Already booked a second trip n Jan 2023 and chose Fox again.",5,CA,"November 20, 2022"
Great service. Great price. Overall great experience,5,US,"November 07, 2022"
Free-cancelation on the reservation I made on their website. Pickup and drop-off were very easy and all the employees were friendly and efficient.,5,US,"November 09, 2022"
I arrived late due to flight cancelations in SLC they honored my booking more than 12 hours late and the lady there was amazing. She was so courteous. I was even given a much larger vehicle at no additional cost. The price was amazing and so was the service. Definite recommend.,5,AU,"November 10, 2022"
Fast friendly sevice. Unlike the last 3 times I’ve rented with other companies Fox had the car I reserved ready and waiting for me. They had enough staff to process the renters efficiently. High marks for Fox and they are affordable to boot!,5,US,"November 15, 2022"

"Have been renting from FOX for years. They always have the best deals, clean cars and stay open 24 hours. It does not get any better than that when in a place like Las Vegas. Leave a bit of extra time as they are located outside the airport but it has never been a problem if you plan properly.",5,N/A,"November 09, 2022"
"I was worried based on some reviews I read, but the pick up process was quicker and easier than competitors. The Fox teammate helping me was friendly and offered good advice. Drop off was super easy too. Couldn't recommend them more.",5,US,"November 14, 2022"
"I was charged an early return fee. A late fee makes sense,  an early return fee is just gouging customers.",3,US,"November 18, 2022"
"This was the first time I have rented a car with Fox. I received a Mitsubishi intermediate SUV that performed very well. The pickup process was much more lengthy and tedious that I have ever encountered with other rental car agencies. I was not able to use my preferred credit card since Fox required me to enter a PIN, a situation I have never had with any other rental car agency. The return process was smooth. I felt that I was being pressured to purchase basic insurance for this rental. I always decline this type of insurance at other agencies since my preferred credit card provides primary insurance. I am perplexed by the unexpected and overly lengthy pickup process.",4,US,"November 09, 2022"
"Overall a great experience. Only downside:1. Agent automatically tried to include gas service;2. Upon return, I was charged again for the rental, which was prepaid, but with a call to customer service, the money was returned to my credit card.",4,US,"November 01, 2022"
Staff was super friendly and efficient. The car was spotless. A great experience!,5,US,"November 12, 2022"
The check in agent was nice. She gave me a Toyota 4 Runner (the extended version). It was way too big for a petite person like me to drive. I asked to switch to a smaller vehicle. Another agent called the supervisor and she up charged me.,4,US,"November 13, 2022"
I gave Fox Car Rental a 5 star cause the entire process from the moment you landed to picking up the vehicle was a breeze. Friendly and knowledgeable staff made it easy as well. Will come back again.,5,US,"November 06, 2022"

"I got scammed. I was  supposed to pay $1,265.77 when I checked-in. Then when I returned the car i received an email showing a $3,326.72 bill. I went to the cashier at the front desk to ask some explanation. He told me that was nothing to worry about. I checked out my credit card activity the day after and I had 2 charges: $1,765.77 and $1,560.95. So I got charged $3,326.72 for no reason. Of course I called the number on my contract but no one answer. I am very not happy!",1,US,"November 14, 2022"
"The price is affordable, and I got the car I want. Pickup process is a bit long because they only have a couple staff members. So far so good.",5,US,"November 12, 2022"
Total scam beware !!! Horrible experience with fox rental. I’m writing up to the Better Business Bureau because they wrongfully charged me double and I have called and fighting with my credit card as well as Expedia because of what they did. They were just adding all kinds of wrongful charges. On top of .. r u ready for this they gave me a dirty car inside and out and I said to the guy do you normally give someone a dirty car and he said well you know?! It was an older car felt unsafe driving it had dents all over it and was dirty inside and out. And then when I returned the car they charged me double what I owe and spent hours on the phone. Absolute horrible expense. Then they gave me a $250 credit like I want to use them ever again . Total scam and rip off buyer beware I had a good experience with thrifty ur better off there,1,US,"November 06, 2022"

"STOP STOP STOPDO NOT USE THIS COMPANYMy wife and I had waited 3 years to visit our family after the COVID lock downAfter a long 11 hour flight we landed in L.A and arrived at the Fox rental depot.Very weary from the flight I initially thought I had lost my credit card needed to complete the rental agreement, I then realized I had forgotten the pin number of the card and to make things even worse my cell phone would not work on any of the local networks making it impossible to contact my bank for assistance, at this point myself and my wife who also has health issues were getting very stressed.The agent we spoke with offered his phone to use as a hot spot so I could access the internet and use my phone banking service, We chatted away gradually feeling more relaxed, it then came to the options regarding insurance etc and as a regular travelers before lock down we were comfortable without the extra charges and explained that to the agent, he quickly printed out the paperwork for us and crossed on the lines for us to sign.Unfortunately this is were I came unstuck, because we were on semi-friendly terms I didn't bother to read the small print and it wasn't until I got home and received my credit card statement I saw I had been charged more than double to what I had expected. being both senior citizens this was a most unwelcome surprise especially when being on a limited budget.I understand now not to trust anyone now and to always read the small print before signing.In future if we are able to visit the USA I will certainly not be using FOX car rentals.BEWARE",1,N/A,"August 29, 2022"
Everything went smooth despite a cancelled flight.,5,US,"November 05, 2022"
"The rental experience was adequate. The vehicle it self was not the best I have ever rented but it got us to where we were going. The check in and check out went well. Leaving the property with the vehicle was awkward, they told me to check in with someone outside and I never found them. But we did find the car so we left. There is a person that checks you out at the gate and maybe that is who they were referring to with their instructions. Check in went exceptionally well. The shuttle driver was okay.",4,US,"November 12, 2022"
"Overall, the experience could have been better.  I was disappointed that the rental rate is so low because they plan to upsell you several options when picking up the car, such as the $11.99/day toll pass (which I never used) and prepaid gas (which I refused).  The vehicle itself was nice enough and returning the vehicle was pretty seamless.  The pick up experience just wasn't that great at all.",2,CA,"November 05, 2022"
"Excellent customer service, they are very friendly, accommodating and grateful for your business.  Pick up was fast, efficient and speedy Drop off was great, Orlando was very friendly, made you feel like a valued customer. He was very quick, efficient and very helpful",5,CA,"November 06, 2022"
"The process was so quick and easy, no hassle.",5,US,"November 04, 2022"
Great overall experience. Only small complaint on the wait for shuttle from car rental facility to Fox location and they only had one vehicle in the classification we rented. In the past they have always had several to pick from.,5,US,"October 29, 2022"
"The only issue was the drop off location, it took us awhile to find it. Otherwise everything was good.",4,US,"November 06, 2022"
"When I arrived at the service counter I was upsold a 4 X 4 SUV (I had reserved a 2 X $ SUV).  My reservation was for $366 and I was told the upgrade would be about $300 more.  However, the final bill came out to be almost $900 which was more than I expected.",4,CA,"October 26, 2022"
Much better than expected. Good value for money and brand new car.,5,US,"October 27, 2022"
"I was able to rent the car and had no issues with it- it ran and was slightly larger than what I ordered.  Although it was an ""upgrade,"" it takes more gas and is harder to park, but I was not charged more, which I like.  The staff at the rental counter was very good.  I was able to get the shuttle from Oakland airport and returned the car to the rental agency without incident.  Pick up was a little slow and one of the shuttles totally blew me off, but another one was avaiable in 10min, so it didn't matter.  I would recommend going on the Bay Area toll website though and paying for tolls once you have your car.  The price is good and I would rent from them again.",5,US,"October 26, 2022"
"Car rental at Oakland Airport was fine and timely, staff was friendly and competent, car itself was good. However - they push an $11.95/day fee to cover all bridge tolls during your rental, without mentioning the free and easy FasTrak option available online to anyone. This discredits the rental company.",4,CA,"November 08, 2022"
"Very easy check in/pick up and return.  Thought it was decent value for the money (everything is expensive right now).  The vehicle was very good.  Only complaint was very back cup holders in van were not cleaned, but that is a minor complaint.  Would recommend Fox.",4,US,"November 02, 2022"

"I paid in advance for a car in Atlanta Airport.  There are no signs anywhere that show where “Fox” rent a car is located.  Finally I asked the Hertz employees and they showed me out to the garage.  The door was locked and no one was there.  My flight wasn’t late or anything.  I was there at the time of my stated arrival.  The Avis employees in the garage said “the girl that works in there left this morning and never came back.”  What? I waited two hours for her endless lunch to end, trying to get a hold of anyone at Fox Rental car, nothing.  You can’t speak to a human.  I finally gave up and rented a car through Avis.  I will tell everyone I know that you will be left high and dry if you rent through this company.  Funny when you pull up various locations they say “Permanently Closed”. What a shock.  Orbitz refunded this nightmare, but my Visa was prepared to do so also.",1,CA,"November 03, 2022"
No lines. Great staff offered friendly and helpful answers to all questions.,5,PL,"November 02, 2022"
"Simply best rental company in Vegas! Me and my family had an amazing experience, new car (2020), no hidden costs. Big plus for professional service at desk (very kind man). Just take two free buses from airport and you will safe much more money than renting from main rental area.",5,US,"November 02, 2022"

"Rented an SUV in Salt Lake City in late October for two weeks visiting National Parks in the area.  On the drive to Moab noticed the steering was a little loose.  When we stopped I looked and both front tires were totally bald.  Only way to return the vehicle was an 8 hr round trip back to Salt Lake City or Las Vegas.  Even on dry sunny days the car would flash warning signs about “possibly icy roads” because the tires couldn’t get any traction.  Ended up cutting the vacation short because a snowstorm was on the way.  When we returned it the first person from 25ft away chuckled and said, “Yeah those tires are bald”.  Went inside and talked to a manager and he said the tires were “legal”. I have photos to prove him differently.",1,US,"November 04, 2022"

"If negative stars were possible, this company would be receiving them. We rented a dirty, beat up car from them and purchased two insurances. My boyfriend dropped the rental car keys into a lake, which granted was his fault. The company refuses to help us for 2 days, so we were stranded. After 3 days of arguing and begging they finally came to get the car at a considerable cost to us. Two months later, with no previous bills or writing they decided to double our charge and send us to collections. Save yourself the trouble and rent from a more reputable company.",1,US,"August 27, 2022"
Good customer service and clean shuttle bus.,4,US,"October 21, 2022"
I rented from fox several times in the past and never had an issue. This time I didn’t get my full deposit back-was $36 short. I understand it’s not a lot of money but still want to know why they kept $36 from my deposit,3,US,"October 17, 2022"
"We picked up our car late in the evening and so there was no line and the process was quick and easy. The customer service representative was quite accommodating. The car we were assigned drove well, was clean and two are liking. We greatly appreciate it the unlimited miles. The price was fair and in the future we will look to Fox for our car rentals.",5,N/A,"October 19, 2022"
"Overall satisfied.  Cars have more miles than competitors, and remote pickup office at Orlando is further from the airport, but that's how rental costs are lower (ours had 41k).  Will definitely use again instead of paying 50% or more higher rates from big name rental companies! Most complaints in reviews about tolls, transponders and insurance are due to people not doing research.",4,US,"October 21, 2022"
Overall good experience. Would use them again.,4,SR,"October 30, 2022"
Excellent service. The shuttle bus driver was so compassionate in his work. We appreciated his help and kindness.Picking up and dropping off the car went smoothly and above former experiences with other rental companies.,5,US,"November 03, 2022"

Scratched up unwashed vehicle with low windshield wiper fluid and we realized our gas tank was 1/4 full after 83 miles on a Camry.  Dropped off 1 hour and 15 minutes early.  Asked if there was a fee and told no.  Was charged 20 dollars for that.  Got hung up on trying to resolve today.  Then offered 36.99 for not a full tank and late fee.  No thanks. Terrible business practices and very dishonest.,1,US,"November 01, 2022"
"Shuttle pick up was quick and driver was friendly and very helpful. Counter staff were amazing. They made sure we had all the important information for our rental. Vehicle was clean and in good condition. Return process was simple and again, staff receiving vehicle were friendly and helpful. We will definitely rent from Fox again.",5,US,"October 26, 2022"
"2 Fox shuttles at LAX passed myself, wife and 7 year old which meant we waited around an hour for a shuttle - we were only at T3 so there is no way BOTH busses were full.  We were absolutely astounded that this occurred but it got worse unfortunately.  Desperate to make our appointment, we decided to get on a Hertz bus as we thought Hertz was close to Fox and we could walk across - we were desperate to get to Fox.  Unfortunately, Hertz was a long way away from Fox so we were forced to get an Uber from Hertz to Fox which then cost around $23... When we finally got to fox 2 hours after our flight arrived at LAX, we found a fairly indignant man behind the counter who acted and appeared like he couldn't care less about our 2 hour journey from our plane to Fox.  He was overly careless about it.  Not his problem apparently - well it certainly was ours. We had rented the VERY bottom of the range car because we would barely be driving it in the one week rental we had booked.  We booked a full size vehicle for $288 for the week, however, the man behind the counter told us that the only car he had was a compact car and forced us to take this car.  IT WASN'T EVEN THE FULL SIZED CAR WE HAD BOOKED, BUT HE STILL CHARGED US FOR THE FULL SIZE CAR AND NOT THE COMPACT CAR.  So Fox now owes me the difference. But the money isnt the point for me as it was only $10 difference - but FOX sets the costs so you need to honor it and NOT RIP OFF YOUR CUSTOMERS - especially after such a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE experience.If you look up my record with FOX, I have rented from your many many times but not over the past year - I was dismayed that your service has become so poor in the gap between renting from your LAX office.  Please contact me to make good on the money you owe me for the difference in the car that was provided - it would be great to get my Uber ride $$$ back from you and also a credit on my next rental.  Im willing to give Fox another chance but you HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT.",1,US,"October 19, 2022"
"Great people, great vehicle, at a realistic and affordable price !!! We will definitely be booking with FOX again !!!",5,GB,"October 21, 2022"

"Rented the car from SLC. Car was filthy. When we returned the car, the gas tank was full and when we returned the vehicle.  They charged us for another full tank of gas. $9 a gallon! Will NEVER rent from them EVER again.",1,GB,"September 14, 2022"
"Dreadful company to deal with. Was offered a FREE upgrade which we didn't really want and which they have now charged us an extra £342 for. The car was dirty, had a chip on the window, the key fob battery wasn't working well and the service light came on within 20 minutes of pick up. The brakes pads needed changing and started grinding badly which was really worrying when negotiating the steep mountain passes. The car was shuddering each time the brakes were applied. Took the car back a day early as we wanted shot of it asap and, rather than giving us an early drop-off refund, they charged us an extra £20 for the privilege! Customer services are not interested in addressing any of my complaints.  Stay well clear of Fox Rentals.",1,US,"September 26, 2022"
"This is now my second time I have rented at FLL in the last 2 months, with another 3rd long term rental next month. counter expert Naz always takes care of all of my needs and more. will continue to be a return customer",5,US,"October 31, 2022"
"Everything was spot on except for 3 things:1. The shuttle from the airport to the rental location does not run frequent enough and it's pretty much impossible to reach the location for them to send one because the phone number doesn't connect you to the rental location.2. There were only 3 agents at the counter and there was a really long line which was moving very slow. When I was leaving 2 more agents came out to help but the damage was already done.3. The priority pass signage was pretty much invisible to see. Had it been placed in a visible area with bigger letters, I would have purchased the service in order to expedite my service. I literally didn't buy it because I didn't see a sign.  I bought my reservation while in line but I did not opt into the priority pass because it wasn't visible and I assumed this is not a participating location.The representative who helped me though was very approachable, friendly, polite and helpful. He helped me out as fast as he could and he did it with a smile. 10/10 goes to him for his service. I love the fact that there were no surprises. Thank you guys for not hitting me with hidden fees like my past experiences with other rental companies.Overall, a great experience because I got a great deal with the one on one interaction with each employee being great.",4,US,"October 21, 2022"
There were minor dents and scratches on our rental. A tear across the back seat approx 10 inches long. When paying the going rate for a rental you expect a quality vehicle cosmetically as well.,4,US,"October 10, 2022"
They are the best out there. even thought the drive from the airport is a bit far to their office. Their customer service is outstanding. Try them and you would regret it. Keep up the great work.,5,US,"October 26, 2022"
Great customer service. I wished it was 24 hours or they had a key drop box option.,5,US,"October 24, 2022"
It was so easy to pick up the car and return it.  The staff was on it.  Great service!,5,CA,"October 22, 2022"
"No waiting time at pick up and at return. All employees were professionnal. Otherwise, due to traffic between the location center (for all banners) in Phoenix and the airport (terminal 3 or 4), the transfer by bus can take up to 30-45 minutes; but it is not related to the rental car provider.",5,N/A,"October 22, 2022"
Very pleasant and efficient employees. Car ran flawlessly. Inside  not the cleanest but useable. I'm a bit confused with billing with the email showing a much higher charge for gas than what we signed for.  Fox Rent a Car has not had time to return my message about this.  Probably would use them again,4,US,"October 24, 2022"
Smooth experience. No extra waiting either picking up or dropping off.,5,US,"October 21, 2022"
Easy to pick up and drop off. Very clean and comfortable vehicle. Extremely friendly staff.,5,US,"October 18, 2022"
"Loved this rental company - Great staff, late hours at LAX",5,US,"October 19, 2022"
"After driving 3 hours away from rental facility, realized the car had a bad battery. Took nearly 2 hours to get thru to customer service only to find there were no close locations for service than the base in Jacksonville,FL. Even though Georgia and Alabama are within the ""driving range"" provided at time of check out.After discussing options (or lack of them) with customer service, I was told that I could have the battery issue resolved at Autozone and simply bring my receipts at time of check in, and not further disturb my vacation. Local manager refuses to return my calls or emails and told his clerk to tell me it wasn't his problem, that I should take up with customer service.",1,CA,"October 15, 2022"
"Car was reasonable. It was comfortable and seemed okay; we had issues with the tyre pressure dropping below an acceptable level while we were driving and had to top them up ourselves. Also, as many other people have stated, the volume of hidden charges is gastronomical. Our rental more than doubled in cost as we were required to sign for insurances and extra drivers on arrival. None of this was declared on booking and had it been, we would have gone elsewhere. The staff at the Denver airport depot are rude too. They look at you like dirt when you ask them to explain what insurances you are signing for and why they’re so expensive. They also try and sell you products you don’t need (like an £11/day pass for the express lane on interstates) and don’t listen when you say no thank you. I’ve had nothing but problems with the customer service since we left and money is simply removed from your credit card with no notice. The car was fine, avoid the company like the plague.",2,US,"September 07, 2022"
Thomas and Boehen were great! They really helped me out when I chose the wrong airport to return my vehicle.   All of the staff was very courteous. I will be renting with Fox again.,5,US,"October 18, 2022"
"The car was fine.  However, BEWARE of fees!  Each extra driver cost money but they probably won't tell you that.  A booster seat costs money but they probably won't tell you that either.  Our rental almost doubled because of adding two additional drivers and a booster seat.  I realize things cost money.  I just wish it had been explained to me.",3,US,"October 12, 2022"
"The vehicle I requested, a Jeep Grand Cherokee, is not available through FOX. I received a 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander with over 65,000 miles, multiple dents and scratched on the exterior and a very rough interior.I was very satisfied with the staff and the service I received from them. But the condition of the vehicles I have rented from FOX have always left much to be desired. I will look to other agencies in the future.",3,US,"October 05, 2022"
Excellent pick up service and returning easy and smooth thank you for helping me with my rental,5,US,"October 22, 2022"
Great experience from reservation to pickup and drop off.  Nice clean car and fair price.,5,US,"October 22, 2022"
"This company was not well known to me and was Leary of the company compared to all the common renters avis, budget and the like. The overall experience was as good and pricing was cheaper on average.",4,US,"October 16, 2022"
It was a good experience.  Since the rental car lot is not at the airport it is a little more time consuming if you are not a patient persons.  They did provide a shuttle from and to the airport.,3,US,"October 10, 2022"
"Good price, but not so nice of a car. Poorly maintained.",2,US,"October 14, 2022"
"Very smooth, easy process from start to finish.",5,US,"October 10, 2022"
Rented a vehicle had to change my trip. Tried to call to change the reservation and could only reach a busy signal. Rebooked with updated dates and then realized this new rental had a 100 mile rental limit. Called and was told sorry there is nothing you can do the rental can’t be changed! This company is horrible!,1,CA,"October 23, 2022"
"Pick up and return processed easily. They added the gasoline fill up price to the bill instead of let you choose to fill up by yourself, this I don’t like.",4,US,"October 13, 2022"
Fox provided us with the best price and a great car rental experience. Will rent again in the future!,5,US,"October 14, 2022"
"The customer agent who helped finalize the paperwork was not friendly. By experience,  I did not judge the whole company on someone's bad mood (maybe she was having a bad day). It happened that I had a great experience renting with Fox. I would rent with them again. Thank you!",5,N/A,"October 09, 2022"
I have not yet rent a car from Fox but made a reservation. Based on some of the reviews I found it necessary to contact the support function to sort out what add-on cost that I would have to consider at the pick up of the car. The person I was in contact with could not specify the potential adders I would have to consider at the pick up. Several e-mails were exchanged but the support was stalling and deliberately misunderstanding my requests. This made me very suspicious so in the end I gave up and will now cancel my reservation for the car.,1,US,"October 22, 2022"
The shuttle was waiting at designated areaon October 12 Filling out needed paperwork was quickly done & I was on my way. Turning in car on October 19 was simple as well with shuttle available to get me back to airport.,5,US,"October 19, 2022"
Place is a joke they and not at the airport  rental  place they are 15 minutes  away you have to take a separate  bus that you wait 20 minutes  for and the car I had was a piece of junk  never use this place again,1,US,"October 21, 2022"
"Checking in was easy and fast.  Car, although small for my size, it was all I needed.  It was smooth to drive, had plenty of pick up and was great on gas mileage.",5,US,"October 15, 2022"
"Excellent experience, Torrie and Tina were both fantastic!!",5,US,"October 12, 2022"
"Good customer service. Helpful staff. Best price I could find for a week long, one way rental. Would use Fox again based on this experience.",5,US,"October 08, 2022"
Cassie was very friendly and professional. She upgraded my car with no extra fees since the one I rented wasn't ready.,4,US,"October 15, 2022"
"Great service. Good value. Nice, modern cars. Excellent choice.",5,US,"October 05, 2022"
"Unbelievably unprofessional. Poor quality cars and poor customer service and then if you tell them you're late the manager gets mad at you and put you on the do not rent list which you can't be removed from. Are these people for real? So sad,so unprofessional",1,GB,"August 25, 2022"
I think there has to be alot more transparency of cost which will be added on when you go to collect the car. I felt I was ambushed with the $11.99 per day toll cost (my In-laws used Enterprise and they weren't charged this toll cost) and then i had to pay an extra £350 so I could have a car with sat-nav( i think this should come as standard). Ultimately I paid far more than what I expected. I will not be using this service again.,1,US,"October 04, 2022"
"The vehicle was generally in good condition, and very clean at the time of delivery. The personnel responsible for the delivery and reception of the vehicle were very responsible and diligent.",4,US,"October 16, 2022"
"FOX rental car from 9/8 to 9/16/2022.  This rental was prepaid thru an Expedia reservation, 3 months before the rental date.  Late at night on 9/8/2022, they gave me a 3 year old vehicle with 65,000 miles, and it shook at 55 MPH.  The next day, called and told them about it.  They told me to take it back, and they would exchange it.  I did that. The next one was a 2 year old car with 55,000 miles. When I got my credit card statement, I found that they had charged me for a 1-day rental when I exchanged the defective car on the second day, but I prepaid, so there should have been no additional charge. I called the number on the statement, and they told me that the rental location would call the next day about the $30.34 charge.  The next day, October 19, 2022, a woman called me from FOX. (This review app would not let me show the correct Date of experience.)  She told me that I should have immediately returned the defective car on the night I picked it up.  (I can never 'should have' done anything).  When she asked me what the return date was, I initially made a mistake on the return date by one day, and when I tried to correct it, she accused me of ""changing my story"", then refused to listen when I repeatedly said the correct return date, kept talking over me, then she hung up on me.The credit card statement shows Los Angeles for the rental location for the $30.34 charge and for the $150 security deposit.  I don't know why.",1,US,"October 17, 2022"
I'm terrible with names but the woman who checked me in was above and beyond nice and helpful. She assisted me with upgrade and gave me information on things to do in the area. Great experience.,5,US,"October 11, 2022"
Needed a rental for a wedding and used Fox. It was my first time with this rental company and I was pleasantly surprised by the efficiency. Staff was friendly and the whole experience was seamless. Would use again!,5,US,"October 14, 2022"
"It was GRRREAT , Would do it again",5,US,"October 12, 2022"
"Very convenient location @ RSW. I wasn't flying and since it's on the outskirts of the airport, it was easy to find and get in and out of. I had reserved by phone, and the pick-up process took only a few minutes. The return was even easier. The agent had upgraded me without me requesting, and the SUV was clean and handled nicely.",5,US,"October 09, 2022"
"To keep it short, I'll just say the salesman was VERY pushy about getting the insurance and EXTREMELY pushy about the Toll fee protection which is exorbitant ($12/day is ridiculous when you can avoid toll roads by using your google maps). The car was in fair condition with stains, scrapes and dings. More concerning that the oil light came on before we left the parking lot (which they said to ignore) plus the steering control light came on later during our trip. The return process was absolutely stellar (super sweet lady checked us back in) and the shuttle drivers to and from the airport were absolutely wonderful. In the end, the price was right and it got us from point A to B. Can't say anything good about the counter guy who was a smarty pants.",3,US,"October 06, 2022"
Seamless experience from beginning to end and car was much better than expected. I will definitely use Fox next time.,5,US,"October 12, 2022"
This is my first time using this company I’m super satisfied with a friendly staff from this location,5,N/A,"October 15, 2022"
"This was by far the least expensive rental. Be aware though that you're going to want/need the $11/day toll box (saved me about $75 as I went in and out of San Fran quite a bit) and there was another charge (not insurance I have my own) that brought my $175 rental up to over $300. This is typical when renting cars. I rented out of OAK in California. The service representatives were super friendly and knowledgable. Theres an off site center for all car rentals at OAK and theres a 24 hr shuttle back and forth. I had stayed overnight at a hotel though and took and the hotel shuttle there, it was a short, easy ride. My car had some damage to the exterior, so make sure you fill out that paperwork and take a snap shot of it. They offer both 1/2 and full tank gas refill. Worth it $1.25-2 cheaper then any gas stations I saw. Totally happy with everything. I travel all over the world and frequently.",5,US,"October 03, 2022"
"The pick up and shuttle from the airport was good. Collection was horrendous and took ages. The car itself was OK but not exactly brand new, with quite a few bumps and scratches and the dash rattled a bit. The drop off procedure was good as was the shuttle back to the airport (except the air con was broken). The main problem was I got stung with over £700 charge on my credit card after the event for damage and liability cover that I hadn't been made aware of when picking up. I managed to get this refunded but as you can imagine was quite worrying when I hadn't expected it. Also overpaid on the toll charges as I didnt really need it when just driving from Orlando to theme parks, but this wasn't adequately explained either. Possibly just unlucky with the guy who checked me in..",3,US,"August 31, 2022"
The drop off was unorganized a lot of people barked and didn't know what to do next. They should have emailed us to dish leave the car there. My own car had performance issues vibrating tires that were worn out at 45 miles an hour it shook. Also there was a rattling engine noise in my vehicle that didn't go away at low speed it sounded like something with clicking or something,3,US,"October 01, 2022"
Fox had the best price for rental for our vacation. We received a great SUV and thoroughly enjoyed our trip. We had no issues with their service.  Great job!,5,US,"September 30, 2022"
Best price and pick-up and drop off were the best thing.,5,GB,"October 11, 2022"
"Pick up took ages, nearly 2 hours. Shuttle to and from airport was superb. The car was excellent, didn't get the one we ordered but got upgraded so we were happy. Drop off was easy and excellent. Price was easily the best available. Perhaps we were just unlucky with pick up delay.",4,US,"September 17, 2022"
Car had a lot of miles. Everything else was perfect.,5,US,"October 12, 2022"
Fast check-in.  Car I wanted.  Fast drop off check-in,5,US,"October 01, 2022"
The lady who checked us in was wonderful.  The bus was there when we got to the airport and was there when we brought car back.  Everything went smoothly and would recommend them to anyone.,5,CA,"September 25, 2022"
Service was fast and convenient. Henry was such a great guy to deal with. Overall my experience was awesome.,5,US,"October 05, 2022"
"My rating is 5 stars because of an employee in Fort Myers FL.  Her name is Amy she is from OH but works out of the fort Myers office.   She was amazing!   She helped us with our reservation and the drop off process.   She took very good care of us.  We rented a van so we could cart our kids around while they were visiting.  She took the time to listen to our plans and help us make the best decision for us and the plans we had for the week.   Our rental was for the week before Ian hit, so my review is late.  But I didn’t forget even after all the trouble with the hurricane.   She made a lasting impression.  I am grateful to her and her level of professionalism and kindness.  Thank You Amy!!  Sincerely Robert and Lori Pell",5,US,"September 16, 2022"
We loved the 4 door jeep. The shuttle was easy to find at MCO Orlando airport. Pick up and drop off was a breeze.,5,US,"October 06, 2022"
"Best rental car pick-up / return experience! The team made it so easy, I was sure something was missing, but they did a great and thorough job. Would highly recommend. Thanks!",5,US,"October 05, 2022"
Overall we were very satisfied with the rental. The original car they assigned to us had some tire issues therefore they switched us to another car immediately. Price was best in seatac airport. I expected worst but was given the best. Thank you fox,5,US,"October 10, 2022"

Fox Rent A Car - Rental carDo not rent from them . No customer service. We rented a Mitsubishi and the catalytic converter was stolen from the hotel. That being said I filed a claim with ins and then they promised to car a new car brought to us in the morning by 9am. I told them it had to be there by 9 we were meeting family at 10. He assured me it would be there his name is Mathew from roadside. Three times I asked him if he was sure and he said for sure will be there. So we had to Uber . Car did not get there until 2pm. Tow truck guy said never rent from this company he tows 25 of there cars a week because of this problem. Also vehicles are older and have over 75000 miles and they rent Mitsubishi veh wich are the easiest to get catalytic converter. When I dropped car off they would not pay for the Uber said I had to call roadside because they are the ones who said veh would be there not him. Hear I thought they were one company but all they do is pass blame. Well roadside would not help either they said to bad not there fault. They take no responsibility for anything. Now we have to pay our 500 ded and 100 in Uber charged because they did not bring my car in time. Never rent from this company.,1,US,"October 08, 2022"
"Fox rent a car is fantastic to work with.  From reservations to rental, to accident claims (yes I was rear ended), and turning in the car they were helpful and efficient.",5,US,"September 30, 2022"
"Not the nicest location but the price was right. In Miami the location is off site but the shuttle was quick. The rental and return experience was fine. They strongly recommend you get the toll pass, but depending on where you are going you might not need them if you want to save $12/day. The only place you can't avoid them is on a couple of the causeways and going south out of town (Alligator alley)",4,US,"October 08, 2022"
Very easy to check in car performed right customer service was awesome. Will totally rent from fox again.,5,US,"October 06, 2022"
Kany in Seattle at pick-up location was awesome. I just was disappointed with the amount of up-sale that was done.,4,US,"October 05, 2022"

"DONT USE ! Con artists Over charged me £1000, sneaky underhand. I expressly told the girl no extras. No insurance no sun pass. I had 3rd party cover and would pay tolls. Really bad really really bad! Stay away",1,US,"October 06, 2022"
The Fox location is farther than I had expected. However the overall experience was positive.,4,US,"September 26, 2022"
Mayra and Dasca were wonderful agents and very helpful.,5,US,"October 04, 2022"
Pick up at the Tampa airport and customer service was outstanding.  The woman at the desk even walked me down to my rental car.  When returning my rental car to the Fort Myers location the woman who checked me in gave me a ride to the Fort Myers airport to pick up my personal automobile.  She is a genuine asset to the Fox Rental operation.  Kudos to her.  I Definitely will rent again from Fox.,5,US,"October 03, 2022"
Amazing Customer Services! Nice and clean car!,5,US,"October 02, 2022"
"Horrible experience, the guy at the counter told me a lower rate to have them fill the gas by 25 cents a gallon and DID not mention the crazy mark up for fees and taxes - I ended up paying twice what I would have if I had filled up myself. When I called the customer service line - I was basically told over and over that there was nothing they could do and I also found out I was charged for an upgrade that I did not actually have. I spent 30 minutes on the line during which I was put on hold 5 times while they ""checked"" - When I did not get tired and hang up they ended up saying there was nothing they could do. I will never use Fox rental cars again and I would advice you not to either.",1,GB,"September 26, 2022"
"Misleading sales representatives gave incorrect information at the check in about fuel being cheaper if fox fill up and cost an extra $130. Misled around costs although booked through Wise Cars there were meant to be no hidden costs... this was incorrect, there were lots of hidden costs. I wouldn't use them again.",1,US,"July 10, 2022"
"It was fast, easy to pick up and get on our way for our weekend trip",5,US,"September 30, 2022"
"The team at Fox rental car near Orange County Airport was great. The shuttle runs every 20 minutes and a 5 minute ride was easy enough. Upon returning the car, we were greeted with friendly service and the transaction took 5 minutes. The rental station was very clean. Thank You and we will see you again .",5,US,"October 01, 2022"
"First, we received ""the best"" service from everyone. From Kali who was so pleasant and helpful, made it possible for us to upgrade our vehicle...to the gentleman at the gate leaving the lot who asked where we were headed and directed us on how to miss traffic(Denver). Vehicle was clean and great condition. We used it for 10 days with no issues and so comfortable. Kali even advised us NOT to fill up in Las Vegas before dropping it off as it would cost less for Fox to fill it. When returning it was quick and easy. Great service and we will use them again. Thank you",5,AU,"September 04, 2022"
"Buyers beware! Think twice before renting with Fox Rent a Car and double check each dollar being charged before signing anything! We were blindsided on two seperate occasions:1. We were upgraded to the full insurance package despite only requesting liability insurance, costing an additional $100 per day at their San Francisco airport location.2. Upon arriving to the Denver location, the booked car was not available so they provided an alternative car and told us there would be no additional charges. However upon returning the car we were advised that we would be required to pay a $150 upgrade fee for the car.Two seperate occasions in different locations hinting at a workplace and organisational culture of extracting every available dollar from customers through untransparent and deceiving practices.",2,US,"September 23, 2022"
"In the website they  said  one price and  went you pick up the Car it was 10 times the price and  extra  charges, be sure to take as many pictures of the car before you leave because they are going to blame everything on you and  check  the gas ⛽️ because if you  put  more than  you get the car they charges  you for that  too  next  time  is better  paid a taxi  is cheap",1,US,"October 04, 2022"
I got a reliable car for an affordable price. The car was on time when I arrived and the price was great. Just vacuum a little more.,4,US,"September 24, 2022"
"It was an easy check-in and drop off process. However,  we had a tire we had to fill up once or twice a day. When we picked up the vehicle it was at night, so in the day light we saw two places where it looked like a stone hit the windshield and it had two small cracks in it. They did not blame us or charge us, I was just concerned it would crack more while we had it.",4,N/A,"September 17, 2022"
"Our first shuttle from the airport set the tone for our experience. Helpful and courteous. The staff was professional but made us feel as if we were important to them. The car was extremely clean, had fuel and was exactly the model we wanted. Return was so easy, and transportation back to the airport was Johnny on the spot! We would definitely rent from Fox Rent A Car again!",5,US,"September 27, 2022"
"Fox has become our first choice for rental cars. We strongly suggest that based on our consistent selections of rental services, Fox would flag our account that we don't need additional insurance and upgrade to avoid unnecessary upsell, time wasted, and hard feelings. We know what we need and will ask for it. We understand the nature of the front sale staff's job, but their pushy tactics, then obnoxious attitude after we decline cause poor reviews that might stop others from renting cars from Fox. However, the back office staff that take care car delivery and return indeed make it up for it. Much kudos for these hardworking guys in the lot!!!",4,US,"September 21, 2022"
Hurricane Ian prompted an early return at a different location- I received great service with no early return/drop fees due to the Hurricane. Wonderful kind service.  We will be back to Florida in the late spring and will be renting again!!  THANK YOU!!,5,US,"September 30, 2022"

I rented at O’Hare airport. Check-in was extremely efficient. When going to the vehicle the staff was very polite as well as a detailed car check was performed with myself and the agent. Returning the car was fast and polite as well. It was a busy weekend for the agents I could see their frustration was mounting but they work through it and I appreciated doing business with Fox.,4,US,"September 15, 2022"
"All was good. Nice new, clean car.",5,US,"September 15, 2022"
Best price in Vegas. No hassle and very friendly workers. The cars are in great condition.,5,IE,"September 14, 2022"
Rented a car at the Orlando location. Paid in full. Arrive to collect car and asked for credit card. Assuming this was for a deposit I hand it over. Lady hands me machine and I question what the $400 was for and was told insurance. I said no I just want the basic insurance. Her reply that is the basic insurance. I said I had already paid for the car so that includes the basic or CDW  insurance. She told me no I had to pay but would I like the full insurance as the basic one didn’t include even a puncture!!!I have rented many cars all over the world and all have included basic insurance. After the initial $700 which is non refundable and $400 it would have been the same price to rent from a company located at the airport. I’m sorry but that is clear entrapment and an out an out scam. I’m furious to be taken advantage of this way,1,US,"September 11, 2022"
"Experience was good, better than others. When we got there to pick up car, not a lot available but was pleased with what we picked. More upfront than other car rental places we used as we had rented a car at another rental who were not as upfront with their dealings and charged us a lot more than we were led to believe we would be paying. Will use Fox again. Transparency is key to providing good service! It is appreciated.",4,US,"September 18, 2022"
Easy process. MEHDI was our representative at the counter and he was so awesome and fast. Took literally 10 minutes and we were in our rental. This is my 4th time using Fox Rental and I will continue using them. Hopefully we'll get lucky and have MEHDI again. Thank you.,5,DE,"September 16, 2022"
"Completely Scam!! Never again! Rent a car on Expedia with Fox, ""reservated"" it online and they told us, this is just a reservation without payment and so we had to pay at the counter. The bill at the end was mostely the double of the original price, because they've taken the reservation as a payment, too! No possibility for getting money back! Deleted from Expedia now... surprise surprise",1,US,"August 28, 2022"
"Counter was not crowded and there was no wait. Pickup was quick and easy, staff very friendly and efficient.",5,US,"September 12, 2022"

Absolute shambolic company. Car was rubbish it brokeOn our second day and took the whole day to replace it ruined our plans to universal studios I am about 600$ out of pocket.Do not use this company the emergency assistant number half of them didn’t work and took over 30 minutes to talk to a actual person every time I rang.Was offered a measly refund for all the trouble. Insulting really Also don’t think you should be forcing your ridiculously expensive toll pass on people. You should be ashamed conning people out of there money.

I never used fox before but I definitely plan to in the future. I was greatly helped by Livia who answered all my questions and made sure I got the exact policy I needed. After a long set of flights it was a relief to get some help from someone who cares.,5,PH,"September 09, 2022"

"Fox is a force to be reckoned with. Their Customer Service Agents presentation both in person and on the phone is impeccable. The vehicles are 100% sanitized, clean and smell good inside.

"First of all you are not going to get the car that you request. Don't request admit size SUV, because all they have is 4Runners. You would end up with a smaller vehicle or a way to big vehicle. Other than that my experience was ok. Only issue, I didn't get the vehicle that I request.",4,US,"September 11, 2022"
Super prices and great customer service. I have used Fox for many years and will continue to do so. The staff are always professional and friendly and all fees are upfront and explained.,5,US,"September 09, 2022"

Guy and the front desk was very polite. The car was on its final days as a rental. It was pretty beat up and had gum smeared on the seatbelt. The shuttle driver from the drop off spot to the Miami airport was rude and was watching a soccer game while driving.,3,US,"September 14, 2022"
Service at the counter was quick and easy. Choosing a vehicle on the premises made it easy rather than being assigned one.,5,CA,"September 14, 2022"

"Made rental reservations for Fox Rent A Car (Guayaquil Ecuador Airport)on the Expedia site, Fox car rental is owned by Europcar. The main reason I picked this company is it offered unlimited miles, I even showed them this when I picked up the car and paid at the airport. When I returned the car they tell me that I owe $430 for going over the miles as its not unlimited. I asked for a mgr/supervisor so I can discuss (no Mgr to call or speak to I was told), since the rep that was there said she it was expedia's fault because they had an error on the site. She also said I have to pay or she will call airport police and I won't be allowed to board my flight home. I paid so I can get back to the US and dispute with Corporate, Expedia and Amex. When I tried looking for a contact # for Europcar Customer Service, there is only an email, which proved to be useless. Called Expedia and they emailed me back 5 days later that they had the same luck I did reaching Europcar, I was told if I would have paid with Expedia they would have given me a refund. But like I paid with Fox Rent A Car there was little Expedia can do to get my money back. I disputed charge with Amex, after about a month later was denied dispute by Amex as I signed  for the $430 charge and the original bill didn't say unlimited miles. I told Amex that the original bill failed to say there was a limit to the amount of miles the rental came with. Long story short, use another car rental company if you don't want to get fleeced. Here is the reply to your reply, I would think that if your company got my Expedia reservation details (unlimited miles) your rep at the counter should have mention that important detail. All she told me was that I would be responsible for any speeding tickets given to me since the country has a lot of speeding cameras and that there would be a hold on some $$$ on my card to make sure your company has the funds to pay the said tickets if I got them. DON'T YOU THINK THE MORE IMPORTANT DETAILS OF THE MILES NOT BEING UNLIMITED SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED?? BUT LIKE YOU ARE COUNTING ON THE EXTRA $$ YOUR CORRUPT COMPANY GETS FROM UNSUSPECTING CUSTOMERS. Look at all the reviews your company has gotten, almost all of them are negative reviews, that's not a coincidence. My mistake for not doing my research before hand, hopefully future potential customers read them and are forewarned.",1,US,"July 23, 2022"
"Avoid this company !! Made a reservation for a car weeks in advance. Get off plane at Ft. Myers airport, walk to get shuttle to go off site to pick up car. Called number listed for Fox. Nothing. Number doesn’t work. Tried contacting them. Impossible. Go back inside terminal and rented a car from a real legitimate car rental company. Fox is a joke !!!",1,US,"September 14, 2022"
The price was great and the car was immaculate. The return process was super easy. I'd use Fox again.,5,US,"September 06, 2022"
"We had a great car for a great price.  We loved everyone we interacted with at Fox, and were so appreciative when they accommodated our desire to go to Mexico- which meant we had to switch cars, etc.",5,GB,"September 12, 2022"
"Avoid, avoid, avoid! Rented a car from MCO in August-22 and I've just returned from holiday and have spent the last week and a half disputing the additional £523 which Fox added to my credit card.  After much investigation, it seems that all of the additional insurance which they try to sell you - which I categorically said no to, they add to your account anyway.  Such a shame as the pick-up and drop-off was a decent experience. One rogue agent in the office - no doubt incentivized to sell add-ons has ruined the whole experience and I will never use this company again. Oh, and they charged me £100 for a full tank of fuel despite informing me that their fuel prices were the same as the gas stations!",1,NL,"August 19, 2022"
"Did not received my refund of 500 dollar. Without notice. After contacted them they charged us for a riduculous amount of 155 dollar for fuel. Remaining amount for liability insurrance we did not agreed on because we already has buyed this from rentalcars, where we made the reservation. We did receive the agreement when we asked for it. They falsified our signature on the part of the insurrance box. Neither fox or rental car are taken any responsibility in this frauduleus behaviour. DONT USE BOTH OF THESE COMPAGNIES TO RENT YOUR CAR!!!!",1,US,"June 30, 2022"
"Since the Covid outbreak Fox has provided the best value for my money, saving me hundreds per rental in comparison to Budget, National and other top tier agents.",4,US,"September 03, 2022"

Excellent experience from beginning to end.,5,US,"September 07, 2022"
Do not rent. The car was dangerous. When I put on the breaks the steering wheel shoke. The brakes were shot. My fault because I was in a hurry. We waited 40 minutes for the shuttle to pick us up from the Denver airport. I signed the insurance form because I was rushed. Doubling my original cost. Stay away.,1,US,"September 08, 2022"
Great service! Fast response with a great solution. Thank you again for the service provided.,5,US,"September 10, 2022"
I had a very good experience with fox rental. My flight was late and the waited for me to come get the car. The staff was very nice. When I dropped off the car it was easy. I will rent with them again.😀,5,US,"September 09, 2022"
Excellent products and great professional rental staff.Always a pleasure to rent a vehicle from Fox at a very affordable price!!,5,US,"August 23, 2022"
"Our first car was filthy, badly stained seats, etc. Fox exchanged, no question. Much cleaner car the second time, but the inside of the windshield was smeared, ie wiped to quickly, and it had a badly worn tire in that no tread was left.",5,US,"August 26, 2022"
Don't rent from FOX.  I rented from FOX Rental during my family vacation. I got a bill 3-weeks later for $98.75 for a total toll fee of $8.75. The additional $90.00 was FOX's admin fee!!!!! No customer service at all. I was shocked to say the least and highly disappointed.  I will not use FOX anytime in the future. I do not recommend this company.,1,SE,"August 19, 2022"
"Great service, great pickup and return. THEN an additional 300 dollars added to the cost that was not quoted when renting the car. I am sure that somewhere in the fineprint you would have found this if I had spent and hour reading it. Completely outrageous!",1,US,"September 04, 2022"
"I was concern about renting with this company because of the reviews. But my overall experience was great. From the moment I arrived, It took about 10 mins for me to get the keys of the car. The car was in good conditions and drop off was straight forward. Didn’t have any fees or extra charges. Will definitely rent from them again",5,US,"September 02, 2022"
"We've used the LAX location twice this year. The staff have all been nice and the vehicles dependable. Only down side is DON'T pay extra for ""priority check in"" as no one man's that podium. We paid twice for that courtesy and waited longer both times.",4,US,"September 02, 2022"
Awesome rental company! Not only was my car clean and drove great but I saved money on my rental with Fox! Gil was especially helpful by ensuring that I didn't miss my return flight. He didn't hesitate to help me. Fox is now my go-to rental company!!!,5,N/A,"September 04, 2022"
"This was the worst place I have ever had to deal with!! First, when we got off the plane they wouldn’t take our reservations because it was on a debit card and they won’t accept debit. No problem, we switched the driver and used a different card so they can charge us double to find us another car to rent! The night before we were leaving the check engine light came on, called to let them know but no answer. Woke up at 5 AM to start the car to go to the airport for our flight at 8 and it wouldn’t crank!!! Called fox for an hour before anybody would answer and at that time it was 6. Fox said they wouldn’t pick us up and take us to the airport but they can send out someone to look at the car and it will take 74 minutes for someone to arrive. We had to call an Uber and pay for them to take my family to the airport so we wouldn’t miss our flight. I called fox to tell them we got an Uber and they will need to get the car. They said they are charging me for abandonment and charging to get the vehicle to their parking lot, an extra $10 a mile!! I am warning you, DO NOT RENT from these crooked people. They don’t have a care in the world about you or your safety!!!! I will never waste my time with these inconsiderate people again!",1,US,"September 10, 2022"

"The worst customer service I’ve ever experienced.Our flight to San Francisco was delayed by 24hrs. We emailed and called the company to advise them of this. When we arrived there was a huge wait and we stood in line listening to some very abrupt and rude staff.When we got to the desk, the paperwork had to be completed again in  spite of us having advised them of our delay.They added on all sorts of charges for insurance, tolls and wanted payment up front for fuel, supposedly at a discounted rate which turned out to be no less that the regular pump price.At the time of booking there was no mention of the fact that they will not accept debit cards for payment, we were only told this at the desk.Neither my wife or I knew the PIN numbers for our credit cards - we only ever use them online - so we asked if we could pay them by going online or by calling but they refused this. I asked if we could use their Wi-Fi so I could log into my bank app and find my PIN, they refused. We even offered full payment in cash as a final desperate measure but this was refused too.They didn’t care that we were a family of four with two young children who would be stuck in San Francisco with no  car.In the end we took their shuttle back to the airport and went to Avis who accepted payment with a debit card, added no extra charges and we had a car within 10 minutes of arrival.If I could give Fox zero stars the I would, their service and the whole experience topped off what had already been a challenging travel day and their lack of flexibility and unwillingness to help was disgusting.Do NOT use Fox!",1,US,"August 16, 2022"

"I'd give them 0 stars if I could.  We booked a van for a trip for my father's funeral. We prepaid for the vehicle. Our flight was postponed.  I called them to let them know and was told there would be no problem.  I waited in a 30 minute line (no other agency had a line - their check in process is the worst).  The very rude agent refused to honor the reservation because my daughter did not have a credit card in her name.  I was paying, but she was driving, because I have a disability (she is over 26), we bought the insurance so they were covered if anything happened. Another agency was able to rent us a van, without any issues at all.  Now I am stuck trying to get a refund.  Please be warned the $10/per day savings is so NOT worth it.",1,US,"September 03, 2022"
From pick up to drop off - everything was great! Will note to add a driver it was ~$10 a day so do keep this is mind as this will be an additional charge after booking online. Upon returning the car Fox just took us back in our rental - no need for the shuttle transfer which was awesome.,5,MX,"September 02, 2022"
"SCAMMERS! Worst Car rental company and service EVER! My family of five, with a 8 month old baby, booked through Fox's rental service website for an economy car At Cabo San Lucas airport for a week at $55.00. We thought it was odd that they did not let us pay online ahead of time. We called Fox's customer service to verify and that we had insurance for rental services through our own company and credit card. Fox customer service said there would be no problems and just to deny their private insurance and pay upon arrival. Upon arrival at Cabo airport and EuroFox's rental counter, they verified we booked and drove us to the rental car parking lot. As soon as we got inside the clerk attempted to sell us their insurance and charge 3X the amount listed on Fox’s website quote. Before turning over the keys they mandated we pay them $60 a day for insurance or put a $12,000 hold on our credit card. After 2 hours arguing with them and their 3 persons sales strategies, we had to call a taxi and go without.",1,N/A,"September 02, 2022"

So, we went back in and got what we originally booked. A 2-wheel drive, 4-cylinder Nissan Rogue. We had it for 6 days and drove as high as 13,000 feet in the Rockies and had absolutely zero problems.

"Total lack of transparency. Waited over 2 hours at midnight at their Orlando hire after a delayed flight where we’ve been charged for a load of extras we explicitly said no to. Customer service basically saying ‘well you’ve signed the contract so…’. Yes we did sign a contact, but being stressed and having an advisor telling you they they will not add those extras on and to ‘just sign here’ and that it ‘just outlines everything we’ve been through’ you usually take as gospel! I can’t believe that we trusted your advisors who have added everything in we asked not to then asked us to sign on the dotted line…completely taking advantage of the situation of waiting very late at night with children and ealderly people to look after.

"Update:  FOX responded by telling me where I could find the policy on the sunpass.  That’s it.!   No one is taking accountability for anything !   It took multiple attempts to drive off with a decent clean car on top of the misinformation given regarding the sun pass. The gas policy was written on a separate paper with the damage policy of which I happen to read as we attempted to drive off.  They didn’t even offer a discount/refund for our troubles considering that we wasted time ( 1 1/2 hours ) waiting for them to get it together!  Let’s ignore  the fact that they charged us for a full tank of gas but actually gave 3/4.  If I didn’t check the gauge before I pulled off the lot that would have also been our problem. Basically if you choose to rent from them you must double check behind these people on everything because they aren’t an honest company that stands by their word or product . Save yourself the headache .  Go somewhere else.   The WORST experience ever !   We arrived and the agent explained options and that we can get a sun pass for $11.99 and didn’t have to worry about tolls , we can get prepaid gas, didn’t have to fillBefore return etc etc.  Sounds Great so  Mr signed, trusting what the Rep saidand neglected to read the fine print on  contract before signing  because we were very tired due to the flight delays.   We  get the keys get to a Mitsubishi Outlander and it was absolutely filthy, scratched and dented and the arm rest  inside was worn and nasty looking.  I refuse to get in it so Mr goes back Inside and returns the car and rents another.   This car was  Nissan Murano which was better but all the windows including the side mirrors  were all dirty and there was dirt on the floor and armrest inside.   I was aggravated so I took wipes out of my bag and wiped the armrest and seats off and we get in.  We now drive towards the exit and noticed we don’t have a full tank of gas !!!   Aggravated ,  we go back AGAIN and return the car and they apologize  and take the car to get washed and to fill the tank.  20 mins later we get in and there is water running down the front windshield.  We can’t even see!  We put on the windshield wipers clean it off so we can see and finally drive off……...1 1/2 hrs later!  Here is the bait and switch …..  We are back home in NJ now and took a closer look at the contract and realize the agent lied……it was $11.99 A DAY not $11.99 for the rental .You have got to be kidding me!  Who is spending  that much a day on tolls ?????   This sun pass was an additional $88 on top of the rental fees.  What a ripoff!   When we call to complain we were told we should have read the contract and Mr signed it so we are responsible.  I tell the Rep Actually we had to switch cars so we didn’t sign the second contract.   She said that doesn’t matter we are still responsible for it since we signed for the 1st car that we didn’t take.  Horrible horrible experience . MoralOf the story ….Read your contract !!!!",1,US,"August 27, 2022"
Picking up the car was easy. Did no have to wait long for Shuttle from airport. Dropping off was great too. My CC had been compromised and the staff was knowledgeable about getting this changed and to the airport in a timely fashion.,5,US,"August 25, 2022"
"From my arrival at SNA to my departure, all of the FOX employees I encountered were fast, friendly, knowledgeable and courteous. I was in my rental within minutes of arriving at the FOX rental office, and was upgraded to a full size SUV. To my surprise my rental was more fuel efficient than I expected, so the fuel costs did not blow my budget. My car was clean, comfortable and best of all AFFORDABLE! Kudos to FOX at SNA location for a job well done.I remain a loyal FOX customer.",5,US,"August 16, 2022"
It’s in a foreign language but it was good,5,US,"August 25, 2022"
"Great pricing and service! Just know that the pickup and dropoff office is offsite. You'll get great service and we had no lines, so it's well worth a wee shuttle ride.",4,US,"August 25, 2022"
"Overall service has improved since the last time I rented from FOX. In Denver, FOX tends to have the best rental rates. The pick-up from the airport and registering for the vehicle may take a little longer, but financially it is worth it.",4,US,"August 01, 2022"
"Online reservation was easy and Fox had the best prices. Checkout was fast and the agent who helped me (Ciara at SeaTac airport) was super nice. Check in was even faster, took no time at all. I would definitely rent from Fox again.",5,US,"August 20, 2022"
It's very fast and easy for pick up and return. Will definitely use again.,5,US,"August 24, 2022"
Excellent experience.  Reasonable rental charge as compared to any other in the area.  An older 2019 vehicle which was totally fine with us.  Just make sure to check the car out for any dings or dents and mark the form provided at time of rental.  There were a couple that was not marked that we notated on the form so we wouldn't be charged with any damage.  The small suv was excellent so much so we are considering purchasing one!  The shuttle service was excellent.  I note this because I have to use special assistance in the airport.  The drop off and pick up is a six to seven minute walk.  I was seriously dreading being dropped off after the return because I knew I couldn't make the walk.  Fox dropped us off at the terminal and for that I am so thankful.,5,US,"August 20, 2022"
"The line was long for pick up, they only take credit cards with a chip. Drop off was smooth and quick.",4,N/A,"August 13, 2022"
"We were charged $1,500 over the quoted rental fee.  We rented from the Orbitz website and also rented two kid car seats (don't do this, bring your own or find some used ones.. one seat cost us over $300! for 2 weeks, but we were only charged for one.)  We were talked into other insurances as well, totally unnecessary I think, which upped the price also dramatically.  When we returned the car they also wanted to charge us for cleaning, $250, but there was a car wash nearby and I vacuumed the car for $3.  We waited over an half hour for their airport shuttle, which made us late for check in at the airport.  The shuttle is supposed to run every 10 min, but two passed us by saying they were on break.  When I enquired about it at the counter, the agent said he was busy with another customer.  The driver of the shuttle also dropped us off at the wrong terminal which made us additionally late.  In short, I'm very upset about the end cost of the rental and find it very misleading to the customer to say it will cost something, then have a whopping $1,500 additional costs.  While we knew we would incur some additional costs, we would've booked something different had we known.",2,US,"August 24, 2022"
"Car was ready, clean, no issues, and easy dropoff.",5,AU,"August 23, 2022"
"My wife made a booking through a third party for a fox car rental, we paid through her credit card, booked through her credit card and named me as the driver. On arrival Fox showed us the car we would be taking but later refused giving the car as the credit card wasn’t in my name even though my wife was with me and we had the same last name, they refused to change the booking to my wife and for her to be the main driver as her passport was USA but drivers licence AUS, even though they’d accept my licence AUS and AUS passport. My sister in law ended up booking the same car and was promised we’d get a refund through third party, we are still fighting for our money back ($2700) and third party saying Fox rentals got money for both bookings. We paid twice plus extra $420 for me to be a named driver and we drove away in exactly the same car. What absolute scamThird party has been emailing Fox and escalated issue with fox but fox not responding to third party for over 2 weeks now",1,US,"August 23, 2022"
"All employees were professional, hospitable, polite, helpful, and knowledgeable. The rental process was simple and stress free. I will definitely rent from Fox again!",5,US,"August 21, 2022"
Good overall experience and a good price pn the car.,5,US,"August 21, 2022"
My experience was not really bad. My only complaint is that I reserved an SUV but was told at check in that there weren't any. I am over 6 feet tall and the Toyota Corolla (I think) that I was given was quite small. I smacked my knee on the dash every time I got in the vehicle and there was not a lot of headroom.Customers want what they reserved so they need to do better at making sure the type of vehicle is available.,3,US,"August 12, 2022"
"Very fast and convenient. No surprises if you read your contract. Good support, we got our tire replaced fast on Saturday for free with just the basic coverage.",5,US,"August 21, 2022"
"I booked a car with Fox through a third party.  Their policies are one sided and when I had my license stolen right befor my rental, they refused to work with me and kept pushing me back to the company I booked through who pushed me back to Fox.  When I called and could get through to Fox via phone, I spoke to a call center somewhere in Asia that could only read from a script and couldn't use logic or offer solutions.  When I tried to call the ""local"" phone number listed for my city, it just re-routed me to the call center.  As soon as I found my license stolen and before my car rental time, I called Fox to find an alternative solution, even picking up the car late in order to get a replacement licence or swithing the reservation to my wife's name so she could pick it up but they couldn't offer any help at the call center.  When I asked to speak to someone high-up that was never possible.  In short, with Fox, you have no agency or recourse and you have to strictly comply with their one-sided policies.",1,US,"August 20, 2022"
Awesome customer service. Never had problema.,5,US,"August 18, 2022"

"Very good rate and reasonable access from Burbank airport terminal. Friendly stuff working with smile and kindness . ( another attendant could be help when more pickups are scheduled , we wait about 10minutes before we were served )Car was precisely as booked ( Toyota Camry ) with middle trim level ! Vehicle was scratched band bruised from all possible sides and fully operational.Car has newer set of tires ( 42k miles ) of some unknown budget brand that at highway speeds cause vibrations ( please use quality brand tires so driving experience of your customers will not suffer) also car has no flier mats just bare carpet . ( I do not care but it will affect car value ) Return was swift and friendly.All together I can recommend this rental company",4,CA,"August 19, 2022"

"I was hesitant to book with Fox since I had never used this company. I was pleasantly surprised with my experience in Austin, Tx. The pick-up and drop off went smoothly. No hidden cost. Great experience. I will use them again!",5,US,"August 09, 2022"
I always got great expririence with Fox!!!,5,US,"August 17, 2022"

"The worst experience rental car in Guatemala and with this company, I arrived at the airport wait and call and when someone answered I hang up the call, half an hour later a man arrives to ask me if I rent a car I told him that if and I never come back, I had to rent another car and from Now I'm asking my money back insurance.",1,US,"August 15, 2022"
"Great, quick check-in. Shuttles were timely. Received a hybrid vehicle, which was great. It had 80,000+ miles on it and was 3 years old. It had lots of wear and tear- dings, dents, scrapes, hail damage, etc. The car was not clean inside or out, which was disappointing. Then we had a tire issue within 2 hours. It cost us half a day of our vacation to get the tire repaired and then to get it replaced. I am just hoping we do get the reimbursement we were promised. I don't care about a beat up car, as long as it's safe and clean, but this car wasn't safe with the tire issue, and it was definitely not clean. Two out of the three customer service reps who helped with the tire issue were great. The third one (Kia) was rude and gave us incorrect information. I was on hold for one call for 35 minutes before I was able to reach someone the day we had the tire issue, and I had to call 3 other times, each of those times with a 15 minute wait. I will say that we got a good price on the rental, and we did like the car itself. The shuttles were good, and the rental process was quick and painless- no pressure. Overall, I would rent from Fox again, if I got a good deal. I would just be more careful to check tires and bring my own wipes to clean the interior.",3,US,"August 03, 2022"
Fox in San Francisco is amazing! Jay was super helpful when we had issues with our reservation made through Travelocity.,5,US,"August 13, 2022"
Pick up & drop off were simple & fast. We had no issues & customer service was excellent.,5,ES,"July 28, 2022"
"Top class rental experience. Professional personnel, cars quite news and well maintained. Shuttle bus from/to airport car rental facilities perfect. The only grey point is, in our case, the gps device: old and not maps updated",4,US,"August 13, 2022"
My husband and I always rent from Fox. This was the first time i had to take a shuttle because the car site is NOT at the airport. I can't appreciate the shuttle service. The driver who took us back to the airport was rude and speeding. He's the reason for my 4 🌟 instead of 5,4,GB,"August 04, 2022"
"San Francisco depot worst I’ve used was charged $25 dollars for returning vehicle not fueld I refuelled to full 1/2 mile from depot and returned vehicle immediately ,I also waited till the vehicle had been checked and was given the all ok everything was in order the following week I received charge on my credit card with no information why , I would not trust fox cars and especially San Francisco depot to treat people properly",1,TR,"August 12, 2022"

I had the best customer service. The rep was kind compassionate and patient.  She made everything easy. She is the face of Fox!,5,CH,"August 11, 2022"
"The staff were nice and helpful, but they should inform you that you need to take a shuttle, which is at the end of the parking area, to get to the offices which are located outside the airport.Furthermore, once the car has been assigned, it is necessary to check the various defects, we had to request the replacement of the car as it had the front bumper partially detached. Pretty good prices.",4,US,"July 21, 2022"
Service was fast and professional. The car we rented was as advertised and met our needs nicely for the duration of our rental. Probably the nicest staff I’ve experienced when renting a car!,5,US,"August 06, 2022"
It is cheaper than Enterprise but the checkout process was bad. Forty five minutes wait time to get served. Office space so small can only fit 3 customers in at a time. The car they give you is not what you picked online. It is what is available and has similar capacity. I did not like that.,4,GB,"August 09, 2022"
Rented a car from Orlando airport branch. On arrival it was suggested that I take out an advanced toll charge plan and I was advised (now obviously fraudulently) that from my apartment location to Disney and Universal theme parks I would have to pay several toll charges that would make the plan beneficial. I have incurred NO CHARGES after half my holiday and expect none for the rest of my time here - and for that I have been charged $179.99 + tax. DO NOT TAKE OUT THIS PLAN IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO TRAVEL LOCALLY ONLY - despite what the Fox employees might tell you!,1,US,"August 09, 2022"
"I rented a car with Fox for a little over a week (July 26th-August 6th, 2022) from the Ontario Airport location. My personal experience was very good. I arrived a little early due to my plane arriving early, but they were ready for me. The pick up process itself was quick. I've had issues with damage and I check THOROUGHLY, but there was a young man there who did not appreciate me taking my time to check the car out. I wasn't even working with him, but he felt the need to comment on what I was doing. When you have had issues in the past and car rental places trying to place the repair on you, you learn to be thorough. The young lady I was working with did attempt to comfort me in saying they weren't that type of company and that they were looking for scratches longer than a pen/pencil, dents and big issues that would render the car not rentable.Now there were a couple of things you need to be prepared for that you aren't told beforehand, especially if you are renting using a 3rd party. You are told that you have to pay for their insurance, which you don't have to. Check with your insurance to ensure it will pay for any damage otherwise, that's like $400+ they are going to charge your card. There was another one but I don't recall what it was. None the less be sure you are paying attention and save yourself some time and hassle later on. Overall, the experience was a good one. A couple of people don't make an establishment bad nor do a couple make it good. It's a team effort and overall their team effort is good. I'd recommend using them as long as you read their requirements and pay attention to the things being said.",4,US,"July 26, 2022"

"We found a good deal with Wisecars and was referede to Fox cars. 500 $ to be paid up front to Wisecars and then another 200 $ at pickup at. At pickup it shows that Fox cars need a creditcard. Debitcard won't do, despite lots of money at the account. Cash niether. Fox cars told us that they would make a note so we could get our money back from Wisecvars, but no. To Wisecar that is a 'no show' and the money is gone... Yes, I now see that small print about the creditcard but we had two Visacards and a Mastercard. After six weeks travel around the US we havent had that problem nowhere else...Wisecar didn't have no problem to keep their 500$ from that same debitcard.Foxcar told us that we would easily get our money back, so we rented another car down the street. No problem there with payment...For that help and for the fact that Foc cars probably made no money on the deal they get two stars instead of one. But it cost us a lot of money that they are not able to recieve payment with our Visa cards...",2,US,"August 08, 2022"
"Rental process and customer service is the worst of all companies. Rude agent at Miami (Juan C), waited for over 90 min in their disgusting lobby while Fox employees scrambled to locate, clean and gas up a minivan that I’d previously reserved on line.

My rental experience was quick and simple. Selene provided me with excellent customer service and I would definitely rent from Fox again in the future.,4,US,"July 27, 2022"
The car was beautiful clean and very good condition the staff was out of this world the manager awesome the place is very clean very organized everything I needed they made it happen no matter what they had to do they made it happen I was always in now. Beatrice I mainly worked with very beautiful person very very nice always smiling. I will not be going to any other rental car place but Fox and hopefully they keep the staff that is at that location I can only hope and pray. Just the prices were excellent I just had a great experience with them and I definitely will be going back and telling people about Fox rent A car.

"I saw quite a few negative reviews and even the hotel shuttle was warning about Fox. In fact it was one of my best rental experiences ever. The staff was super friendly and helpful. I had booked a Santa Fe, but got a great 4Runner instead. Very clean. There is a gas station right opposite the place which is very convenient when returning the car. Only minus point I could think of was that the oil maintenance light kept coming up but the staff had ensured they just did that the week before. The shuttle is convenient. When coming back to the airport there is even a separate check in for Delta right there.",5,US,"July 14, 2022"
"Rented a nice car was clean had quite a few scratches nobody cared told me to take a vidio, dropped off no problem they tend to notice the scratches than. Has been 2 weeks deposit still not refunded, try to talk to customer service hire a translator",3,US,"August 03, 2022"
Small points off for being off site but shuttle was ready and waiting and distance only about 10 mins away from airport. Front desk agent very helpful and upgraded us to an SuV since no midsized cars available. Quick drop off and shuttle back to airport made it a great first time experience renting from FOX. Thanks.,5,US,"July 29, 2022"
"Very smooth and seemless experience from beginning to end. The check-in, car pick-up and car drop-off were super fast and the staff was very helpful and very friendly.

Perfect car, fun to look at, fun to drive and very roomy inside.",5,N/A,"July 23, 2022"

My experience with Fox Rent a Car was very positive. I highly recommend this company to have a positive experience. Picking up your car was an easy process and returning was even easier. The car was clean and in good working order and over the 2 weeks had no problems. Unlimited miles was great as I drove to California to see the Redwoods and had a wonderful time.,5,US,"July 12, 2022"

"Car pick-up took longer than expected as the car I had booked was not available yet. I was offered a free upgrade to an SUV but I preferred a car so was happy to wait. Car was in clean on the inside and was just washed (it was still wet when I picked it up). Car was comfy, everything worked although we could see that it had a hard life as there were several small dents / cracks in bumper. But it was good overall.",4,US,"July 28, 2022"

Fox was amazing! They took good care of us even after getting a bolt in our tire 5 min after driving if off the lot. We put the spare tire on although they would have sent someone to help us and they exchanged the car super quickly.,5,US,"July 29, 2022"

"Total scam. Used their Orlando office for rental. Declined the additional insurance and number plate toll charges. Informed the clerk serving me, and he said that I wouldn't be charged. Returned to the UK and noticed that they have charged this on my credit card. Total scam, as the clerk must be on commission for these items. Shambolic way to run a company.",1,US,"July 28, 2022"

"I got a car that had battery problem. Couldn't return the car because I was 3 hours away. I emailed Fox and they gave me a number to call. I am from another country so my phone didn't work. When I return the car, the employees apologize and give me a $90 refund for my troubles. I think this was a good example of good customer service.",5,US,"July 24, 2022"

"Quite straightforward when taking the car out. I was also given a choice of 3 cars to choose from. Friendly staff. I just wished they""d slow down with their speech, as I found it a bit difficult to understand the American nasal twang! When I was given the keys, I wish there is a staff to go through important features of the car! Like how to open the boot, how to open the petrol to fill the petrol/gas etc the ""minor"" car variations! Not all cars are made exactly the same especially for a British/EU driver! I got a good car, smooth to drive and gave no problems. A good rival to bigger cmpanies of car hire.",4,US,"July 26, 2022"

"Rental price and airport transfer is excellent but there are drawbacks compared to the large companies:Both cars I hired had several dents not marked on the paperwork. I was not comfortable with their system that you need to take photos to evidence that they were there on collection. On return, no dents were challenged so was not a problem.One car had maintenance issues of one tire greatly over inflated and another underinflated. After correcting this it still did not steer in a straight line (tire wear suggests tracking needs adjusting).Need to book and pay with a credit card in the name of the hirer appears unnecessary. Also, for free additional driver, need proof that you have the same surname.Insurance is overpriced so purchased excess insurance in the UK through another company.",4,US,"July 23, 2022"
"Due to a late arrival  in Austin, I was an hour late to pick up my vehicle. They only had two vehicles available and they offered me an upgrade. Every single employee was cordial and well-trained. It was a fast and pleasant experience. Well done!",5,US,"July 22, 2022"
"The rental experience, wait, and car were all fine. The agent however spoke only to my husband, even though the car was on my credit card, I was a driver, and was standing at the desk. In Fox training, remind the folks that women are more than mere passengers in life!",3,GB,"July 21, 2022"
"Generally a good experience. The car was clean and reliable, but had seen better days, making odd noises at start up and hanging underside covers. Would I use Fox again? Probably yes, based on savings as being off-site collection and drop off.",4,US,"July 21, 2022"
"I wanted to give a big shout out to the Fox Rental Car Team at the Phoenix Airport! On behalf of our team, Thank you! We were traveling as a missions team of 22 from Virginia. We rented 3 minivans and an SUV. We were under the impression that we would be getting a Mid sized SUV to accommodate all our gear and overflow luggage per our travel agent. Instead, waiting for us, was a small SUV that was not adequate for our needs. The last SUV literally pulled off the lot right ahead of us. Thanks to our agent, Rosalia Hernendez and the rest of the team that were involved (Kyle, Mike, Haider, and Youseff), They were able to find us and upgrade us to a Grand Cherokee at no extra cost! What could have been a very frustrating experience, turned out to be a model of customer service that is often lost in today's world.  From the time we checked in with Yvonne on 7/8/2022 at 330 pm we had a seamless and efficient start of our trip. Even employees that were at other windows were very personable. I don't think I have ever given out a 100% 10 out of 10 rating, but this difficult situation and how it was made easy, warranted it! Thanks Rosalia, you were great!!! and Thank you Fox Phoenix for doing business in a way that made us feel cared for! I hope the people in charge at Fox Rental Car see this and appropriately commend and reward your people mentioned above!!! --Scott Graham",5,US,"July 07, 2022"

Customer service was nice even at midnight.,4,US,"July 20, 2022"
"I read the negative reviews and can only say they did not even come close to my actual experience.  I had no wait time for the shuttle from the airport and the shuttle driver wasted no time getting me from the airport to the fox off airport location.  I had reserved a camry or similar and received a 4dr jeep wrangler. Check in took only a few minutes and I was on my way. I bought the damage waiver (insurance) and tank of gas and this made returning the vehicle even easier.  Upon returning the vehicle, the lot attendant took the keys processed the return and I didn't have to go in to the rental counter at all.  I was the first of about 8 other customers to enter the shuttle and the drive left moments later. The only down side was,  the jeep was not the cleanest inside or out. Not shoddy but not spotless either.  My rental, plus insurance, plus prepaid fuel was about the same total price as the Camry through other rental agencies without the fuel and insurance... basically a savings of about $200.",5,US,"July 19, 2022"
Had a great experience picking up a rental from Fox. When every other rental agancy was busy with customer and the lines were going very slow Fox was able to get us on our way very quickly.,5,US,"July 12, 2022"
Taking two shuttle busses to the facility is an inconvenience especially when traveling with small children. The car selection and conditions are not the best as well as the cleanness of the cars.,3,US,"July 19, 2022"
Excellent service at every step of the way.  You are my rental car agency of choice where available.,5,US,"July 13, 2022"

"So got scammed by third party booking, had a voucher saying nothing to pay at pick up. Was asked for a credit card for security deposit at Fox rental desk, i gave over credit card and signed where i was told. When i got to my hotel checked the paper work and got charged over £400 for insurance and extra charges! Went back to rental location in Orlando to question the charges and they very politely told me tough that's the charge, bad enough that i got caught with extra charges but being lied to by their operative was the icing on the cake. This was my 16th visit to the states and have never been treated this way before, would avoid using FOX ever again worst experience with a car hire company that i have ever had, would give 0 stars if i could.",1,US,"July 18, 2022"

At first I was not happy with the vehicle that I was being offered but they changed it and took care of me I also had to extend my lease and it was only a $20 day fee to do so dropping off with easy and I got my receipt right away,5,CA,"July 16, 2022"
Good enough car. The rental office is in the terminal. Upselling when picking up the car. Careful to take your time to not double pay for things if you booked through Expedia. They want to sell you more insurance and other add ons which end up making the price double.,3,US,"June 29, 2022"
Was a great experience in car rental. No hassle or hidden fees.,5,IL,"July 16, 2022"
"wonderful employee service at drop off our plane was late and the employee on his own stayed with our rental car.Car was nice.A very, very long walk to car pickup from terminal.",5,US,"July 15, 2022"
Rented from Fox before and always had a good experience. Friendly knowledge staff. Shuttle drivers were very helpful. Rental cars were adequate for my needs.,5,CA,"June 27, 2022"
The pickup and drop-off were very smooth. The car was fine but had some issues like noises and brakes that seemed in need of repair. For those reasons I gave a 4 star rating. If I felt that maintenance was not an issue I would give a 5 star.,4,US,"July 15, 2022"
"The customer service department was excellent. The truck I received was to big for my husband to get in with his cane, and they exchanged for a car. So awesome...",5,US,"July 06, 2022"
Can’t beat the price!  We had a great rental car for our trip!  Anthony at drop off was so helpful and really made sure that we didn’t forget anything in the car and that the process was smooth and easy.,5,N/A,"July 12, 2022"

"Great pickup and return experience in Orlando, FL",4,AT,"July 08, 2022"
"I was provided wrong informations upfront about rentals with debit cards and I could only rent the car with the help of a colleague's credit card. Although FOX is fully responsible for the error, the staff in Austin didn't help or care at all. Worst customer service I ever expierenced!",1,US,"July 12, 2022"
"I gave it a 3 star because they are open 24 hours. Downside of it is that it is off location than the rest of the rental car location,so has to take another shuttle to pick up the rental. Also I was told they have the cheapest gas in town if I decide to buy gas from them but it is all a lie. I was charged the same price as in town. She told there cost is $4.95 but was charged $5.37.",3,US,"July 12, 2022"
This is my first time experience with Fox it was great customer service and I got a good deal .the vehicle was comfortable family size. Definitely I will recommend for any body.,5,US,"July 12, 2022"

Why is this in Spanish? I hope five stars mean the same thing South o' the border!,5,US,"July 10, 2022"
Absolutely terrible service from start to finish. Would never use them again,1,US,"July 08, 2022"
"I got to SFO at midnight & was really concerned about Fox closing, but when I finally got to the counter, I saw 2 employees & was relieved. A very helpful employee called King Chan made the process really easy. He even offered me an upgrade & other options.The shuttle to Fox from the Rental car hub, did not arrive for about 20 minutes & their phone did not work.  Maybe that could be worked on to make it feel safer for late night arrivals..",5,N/A,"June 23, 2022"
"Good vehicles, but be aware of the upselling of toll protection when the agent knew it wasn't needed... make sure to ask about the correct cost of fuel if you don't return full.  we were told 4.80 per gallon... but they also charge a hefty service charge per gallon aproximately 4 per...",4,US,"July 02, 2022"
"We picked up our car at Las Vegas airport.  The next morning we had to return it because all the dash lights came on saying the car needed service.  After a 2 hour delay on our trip we were in a new car.  Now 2 weeks later we are getting billed an additional 500 dollars minus the 150 security deposit because there is an extra fee of 27.00 per day for insurance.  That was never mentioned.  The customer service is lousy, the building is dirty and its hard to reach a live person where you have a question.  I would recommend avoiding this company at all cost.",1,US,"July 05, 2022"
"Great service, highly recommend.",5,US,"July 05, 2022"
"Fox always has the best prices, the nicest customer service and managerial staff, and the final price is never a penny more than expected. Wish they were in more cities!",5,US,"June 28, 2022"
"I've had the absolute worst customer service experience of my life with Fox Rent a Car. I pre-paid for my reservation through Priceline, but when I picked up my car, Fox didn't honor this, and charged me again for the base rental. On top of that, they sold me on a very expensive upgrade I didn't need, there were many hidden fees, and when I tried to explain this to them, they would not listen to me nor would they offer any refund for being overcharged. When I booked this reservation through Priceline, I paid around $500. By the end of my experience with Fox, I had paid nearly $2000. Absolutely horrible! The only good thing I can say about this experience is that the car itself was in fine working condition and I didn't have any issues with it. However, I should never have paid that much for a car rental. If you still choose to rent through Fox, make sure to do it directly (not through a third-party service), and be VERY careful when you agree to the charges.",1,GB,"July 05, 2022"
"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!!!! AVOID ORLANDO FOX CAR RENTAL COMPANY.You turn up tired and just want to pick car up and go wherever your accommodation is,so knowing this before hand this is where all the dirty little tricks comes in.first they will ask you do you want to upgrade insurance,tolls paid,deposit,etc,and even if you said no to all they will still put you down as a yes to all the extra and then ask you to sign agreement on badly light up iPad knowing that you will probably won’t read the agreement because you’re tired and just said no to all of them and you trusted them to do that. !!!!!!!!WRONG!!!!!!!! This is how they make the big moneys.after your holiday you will then get a email with the total ££££ all the extra you didn’t ask for and when you do argue about it the reply will always be the same,( you read and sign the agreement ) To avoid all these little dirty tricks from fox rental next time,record the conversation and get the names of the employees make it crystal clear about all the extra you don’t want and away paid with a credit card as it’s lot easier to get your money back or best still just never use fox rental car again then you won’t have these issue.Think I will stick to other car rentals companies that I have used before and never have any problems or issues with before.first time try fox car rental!!!!!NEVER EVERY AGAIN!!!!!!! BE WARNED AWAY READ THE REVIEWS THERES A REASON WHY IS SO BAD!!!!!!",1,US,"July 05, 2022"
Managed to get a new car and service was nice and easy. Super friendly staff,5,US,"June 28, 2022"
Look for Drissa in Denver.  He is a professional who will get you in and out in no time at all.  He's the best!!,5,DZ,"June 20, 2022"
Very smooth from the beginning to the end. The car was exactly what we ordered and was clean and well presented. Will definitely rent from Fox again.,5,US,"June 20, 2022"

I am happy with the service provided from fox Ontario CA. Car I was looking for was available. I didn't have any issues with the rental part or rental or return. Low prices fast service. Will return this this location when needing a rental. Thanks for experience.,5,US,"June 28, 2022"
"Customer service was friendly and the car was nice. They offered an upgrade at the counter but didn't push it when we said no thanks, which I appreciated.However, I do have two complaints. One, it was not clear when we booked the car online through Expedia that whoever pays for the car is the primary driver. If I had known this, I would not have booked the car myself because I am under 25. I never actually drove the car on the entire trip and we still had to pay the extra fee for having a driver under 25 because we had used my credit card to reserve it. I'm not sure if this was Expedia's fault, Fox's fault, or mine for failing to see a piece of information that SHOULD have been placed in an obvious place but was not.Secondly, and this was a bigger deal to me: the lady at the counter LIED to us and said that having them fill up the car for us when we returned it would be a comparable price to gas costs in the area. She said that it would be $6.35 a gallon and said that this was actually lower than gas costs in San Diego. After driving around a bit we discovered this was not the case at all. But what was worse was when we returned the car and they charged us $9 a gallon. Not $6.35. It was disappointing and frustrating to be conned out of our money like that. I did the math and we would have paid about $57 to fill it up ourselves instead of the $88 they charged us. It didn't raise our estimated cost by much but it was the deception about the cost that bothered me.Anyway, we won't use Fox again.",3,US,"July 02, 2022"
Great experience renting I will rent them every time I arrive to the city,5,US,"July 01, 2022"
"Our experience was a great experience. When we arrived there was a wait, but that should be expected. The wait was not excessive. Ivan did a great job of taking care of us and advising us in the different options and add-one that are available, to make our experience trouble free. The car was in great shape and clean. When we returned the car Daveena made it easy and quick, we didn’t even have to go into the office. Both times we rode the shuttle it was there when we arrived and both drivers were very attentive to the passengers. Both time they asked everyone to double check to make sure they weren’t leaving anything. We would rent from Fox again if we had the opportunity.",5,US,"June 21, 2022"
"Overall good experience. Cost was lower than other mainstream car rental agencies at the airport considering the last minute reservation. Appreciated the service at drop off, specifically Francis at the SFO Fox Rent a Car location.",5,US,"June 26, 2022"
The wait at Fox Rent a Car on a Saturday was too long.  There were too few agents for the crowd of customers.  The agents ignored the line and spent too much time with individuals.  When we finally picked up our car it was not as promised but a dirty SUV with 94K miles on it.  It was old and sounded like it needed maintenance.  Returning the car went much better.,3,N/A,"June 28, 2022"
The person at the front desk was very unfriendly but the all process was easy going with a good price deal.,4,US,"July 01, 2022"
Easy all the way. Pick up and return!,5,US,"June 29, 2022"
"Little bit of a wait for the shuttle to fox, and a little wait to pick up the car but thats expected now a days. all staff were very polite and friendly. no issues at all.",5,US,"June 29, 2022"
"Fox is a wonderful rental car company but has a bad perception about it's customer service.Great rates, great cars, but they need to work on providing a better experience to customers who just arrived after long flights.1. Make eye contact, don't oversell, don't be frustrated and be rude to customers2. State the facts and let the customer decide. You have enough good characteristics to manage a profitable business, no need to push items to customers.3. Be friendlier and smile. Goes a long way.",5,US,"June 18, 2022"
"The caravan I rented was very comfortable & roomy for our family vacation. If I'm ever in need of a rental car again in San Antonio, I will choose Fox & recommend them to my family & friends!",5,US,"June 19, 2022"
Honestly the only problem was the price. No mention of military discount. The size of the vehicle & comfort was good. The staff was nice & friendly. But for one night the cost was way over priced.,3,US,"June 29, 2022"
"The agent who assisted me went above and beyond, by extending my rental with ease each time I contacted due to my personal car being repaired making the rental process stress free and accommodating. I highly recommend Fox for the prices, unlimited miles and great staff !!",5,US,"June 20, 2022"
"I would like to recognize Javier, Tay at the pickup site and in Salt Lake City Utah the Mechanic who helped greatly with a tire pressure problem.  I would also like to comment about the roadside assistance or lack thereof help I did not receive when I called in about having four low tires.  The individual kept telling me that I would have to file an insurance claim because I damaged the tires on the vehicle.  NOT true due to the altitude difference in Vegas and Salt Lake the tires when inflated to the proper amount in Vegas would register low in Salt Lake and when reinflated to the proper amount would continue to register low.  I was very disappointed in the roadside assistant individual on the phone.",4,US,"June 27, 2022"
Everyone I interacted with was professional and courteous. I recommend FOX Rent a Car San Diego. The process of picking up and dropping off was easy and there were no hidden costs.,5,US,"June 19, 2022"
Car was excellent.   Tear in passenger seat on pickup but otherwise cleanliness and functions were excellent.,4,US,"June 14, 2022"
"Best experience, I will always use Fox after years of being a hertz gold member. Tony in the pick up was awesome!!!",5,US,"June 25, 2022"
If you arrive at night and your flight is late you probably won't get your car. This is not a 24hr rental agency. I was told pre-pay gas was $4.57 per gallon but was charged $4.77.,4,MX,"June 11, 2022"
Great service. Quick check in and return. Brand new car.,5,US,"June 16, 2022"
"Found FOX rental car at the last minute. Was already having a bad experience while the airline misplaced my luggage. I needed a rental car and the price, service, and vehicle was just what I needed. Convenient location at the airport. Basic SUV. I was satisfied.",5,US,"June 23, 2022"
Waited too long for shuttle at airport.  Needed additional customer service associates.,4,GD,"June 23, 2022"
"Miami location/car failed no spare tire,no jack, and no emergency road side service. If this happen in the middle of nowhere with no cell service this could have been fatal.To top it off I had to pay for the repair my self to get the vehicle back to fox rental car location. To make matters worst the tires plus shop said this tire can’t be patch because the tires was to low and was unsafe . You think they just want to sell the tire but two other shops said the same thing and the other saw it already had been patched were the hole was at. Fox rental car still charges me for the whole rental except the highway tolls. Got pictures to prove but no one cared. I had to pay and make the repair to get the car back. If you have a family with children I urge you not to rent from fox. If you do there lives will be at risk because fox rental car is no problem putting your life at risk to make a dollar.",1,US,"June 23, 2022"
It was an easy ride from the airport. Check in and check out also easy. Staff friendly and efficient. Would use again for sure.,5,US,"June 15, 2022"

"Rental refused by Fox at pick-up based on reasons not part of the terms and conditions: passport and licence need to be of the same country and/or passport needs to have proof of immigration, neither listed in the T&C.Purely unacceptable and ended up being a very costly scam",1,PH,"June 20, 2022"
"Had a very easy and nice experience picking up and drops g off the car in seattle.  We didn’t have to wait at all, and the vehicle was new and clean.Will definitely consider fox again if we need a rental!",5,US,"June 19, 2022"

"Easy to find, fast in and out and great prices",5,US,"June 19, 2022"
Beware the fees added after you prepay for the car.  Service fees and prepaid gas that you may not use.  I ended up paying almost 40% over the quote I paid in advance on Priceline (after turning car in) for a car in Fort Myers.,1,NL,"June 18, 2022"
"What a very bad company! We absolutely do not recommend them! We had a reservation at Toronto airport on 27th of May for 13 days. We arrived 3 hours late, because of flight delays, to pick up the car. To our shock, they simply told us they were sold out, not one car available. Thereafter, not any help from their side. So, we went back to the airport and had to pay a huge price for a car rental at Avis (cost us 1200 CA dollars extra), but at least they helped us.Again do NOT hire cars from this company.",1,US,"June 17, 2022"

"Bad experience and horrible customer service from Fox Rent A Car   ….. rented a car from Fox Rent A Car ( probably for the last time) through Priceline. Price line offered $13 Collision protection and told us we can add it when we pick up the car at Austin Airport. Fox counter agent said they would not honor the $13, even when we have the screen shot to prove, and said Fox’s price is $20 , take it or leave it. That was bad enough, but when I got the receipt in email, we were charged $23.99 plus a about 20% in taxes. Called the number on the receipt, had to wait for about 30 minutes before getting an agent, all the while hearing about the ‘corporate character’, to be told by the agent that he doesn’t care that their employee misrepresented the price at the time of sales. And won’t transfer me to anyone else. Possibly because he would get tagged for not providing right resolution. Not that the $24 they charged extra is a big deal over close to $700 business we gave them. It reflects the company character and their employees accountability. I promised I will post this.Please check twice before dealing with this company.#corporateaccountability #customerservice #worstcustomerservice",1,N/A,"June 15, 2022"

"Highly recommend! The pick up was so easy, fast as well as the drop off!  I don't recommend using third party reservations!  I have had nothing but problems and the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. If God forbid you have an issue you can't fix it at the reservation desk!  You have to get back on line and pray it's ""fixable"" or hope, wait and pray you get a live person on the phone. We had reserved a car through ""Expedia for U-Save"" when we got there they asked for for airflight ticket, me: what? fast forward they don't rent cars to locals! That's fine but it never said that when I reserved the car!  Then the clerk went on to say , we could rent the car but we needed a bill with our name and address on it, no unlimited mileage, proof of auto insurance, and an extra security deposit.  That's all fine and dandy but we didn't have all that with us and we had gotten a ride to pick up the car, we live 20 miles away! Never again will use third party, USAVE CAR RENTALS! Rent direct from FOX!",5,US,"June 15, 2022"
I had a good experience renting from Fox for the first time. They beat the competitor's pricing and the vehicle was in good condition and clean when I picked it up. The return process was quick & efficient.,5,US,"June 15, 2022"
"I made a reservation for Chicago. When I got through all the paperwork and ready to get the car, the agent casually mentioned that I could NOT take the car to Michigan, which is like 30 miles away, and of course where I was going. Pretty unbelievable. It’s not like I was going to Canada. So they left me standing there with no car, and gave me no clear notification when I made the reservation that I could drive the car next door. What is the point of having a rental car if you cannot drive it 30 miles away!? Never again!",1,US,"June 15, 2022"
"Service was fast and efficient, the employees were polite and helpful the process was quick. Thank you",5,US,"June 13, 2022"
"No renten coches en esta agencia. No, le devuelven el dinero, solo credito de la agencia luego de pagar $50.00 por cancelacion.Please, NEVER rent a car here. If you use Pay now reservation, you will never get your money back to your credit card and will have a cancelation fee of $50.00. Their cancelation policy is very confusing, shady and underhanded. They start it by "" If you do not cancel your Fox Pay Now reservation 24-hours prior to pick-up date/time, you will forfeit the full amount of your prepayment"" which make you think that you only need to cancel before 24hours with a fee for canceling, but if you read 20 times you will realize that they only give you store credits. I canceled a car 10 days prior to travel and I they are only giving me credit. UNFAIRE.",1,NZ,"June 14, 2022"
"Easy pick up and return as they're right by the San Diego Freeway and a fuel station is almost next door which helps when returning the vehicle. There is plenty of signage to find your way back. The staff were pleasant and helpful and the vehicle was perfect for what I needed.  Fox Rental also let their vehicles drive to Mexico.  You need to pay a separate insurance for that while you're signing up for the car. Over all, the whole process was smooth and easy and would definitely use them again and highly recommend.",5,US,"May 21, 2022"
The entire process of reserving it on-line to picking up and dropping the rental off was amazingly easy!  Staff went above and beyond to help in any way they could to make my experience as good as it could be.  Will definitely be looking at Fox for my next car rental!,5,US,"June 13, 2022"
"My husband and I just recently rented a car from Fox for a week when arriving in Orlando, FL. The line was long and it didn't seem like most of the people were there knew what they were doing as it was taking a long time to get each customer in and out. When we got the car we weren't too pleased but didn't want to spend anymore time trying to get a different one. The entire time we were driving there are a different bugs showing up out of nowhere in the cup holders, in the door, crawling on the floor. There are roaches of different sizes, ants and other various bugs that are not normally found in vehicles. This leads me to believe that this car has to be sitting for a while not being maintained. To say I was uncomfortable was an understatement. My husband and I tried to air the car out and even spray but I will never be renting from them again, just disgusting. If I could give this rating a 0 I would.",1,US,"June 13, 2022"
Great Customer service with a fair price this is my go to for rental cars 😃😃 🚗,5,GB,"June 06, 2022"
"We booked our car rental using wisecars. Which in turn used Fox Rentals to supply us with our car. We were rushed through the process at Miami airport (after waiting ages for a shuttle to take us from the Airport to the off site location). We were asked if we wanted premium insurance, we said we already had insurance. So they charged us $25 a day in basic insurance. We didn’t know this until we eventually got connected to WiFi and the contract came through. It ruined our trip.I’ve challenged this with the company, but they’re not interested as they now have our money. I would avoid these scam merchants! There’s a reason why they come up so cheap and there’s probably a reason why you’re reading this review. Trust your gut and avoid!",1,GB,"June 13, 2022"
"My partner booked with FOX and to be honest I read the reviews and was concerned she was stubbon and wouldn't change the booking,I'm happy to report I was totally wrong this was LAX airport site by the way. we had been in the city two days and made our way there by service bus easy to find, friendly efficient agent even gave us an upgrade. Car is not new, maybe this is what people don't like, its a 3 year old Fusion 78,000 but everything works is ideal the 2nd driver is included. so nothing negative to report and i would use FOX again.",5,US,"June 12, 2022"
"Our experience with Fox rental car was very good. The shuttle to the rental office was quick and picking up the car was very easy. The car was a new Toyota Camry. It was very clean, and well taken care of. We had it for 2 weeks, and didn't have any issues. It got great gas mileage, which helped, because gas was 4.80 a gallon. Returning the car also was very easy. Thank You FOX.",5,US,"June 12, 2022"
"I was worried that the car pickup would be difficult and time consuming,  especially after reading some questionable reviews.  Nothing could be further from the truth. The paperwork was simple. The associate was knowledgeable and friendly. We went and selected the car from Emma.  She was great, another gem! The return process was simple and we were on the shuttle for our departure in minutes.  This was at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airpost. This was our second time using Fox.  We will always use them.",5,US,"May 25, 2022"
"Made reservation 1 month prior but after waiting 20-30 minutes or so for the shuttle to arrive the driver told everyone that no cars were available. That was 9:30pm. Only my hard head and persistence got me a car that night. Finally, I was able to persuade the driver and magically one car appeared on the radio of the driver. Anyway, it was late but I eventually got a brand new car with 40 miles,",4,US,"June 11, 2022"
The agent was amazing 👏 He was patient and friendly. His readiness to serve was delightful. He was talkative with a great smile.,5,US,"June 07, 2022"
"am extremely disappointed in Fox Rental Car. I usually rent from two other rental car agencies and I tried Fox this time and I will not use them again. My initial reservation was for 1 week and it was $220. We wanted to extend our reservation by a week and to extend it was an ADDITIONAL $504, which included a $190 “extension fee”.This is a shady way to “force” your current customers to pay more, simply because you can. They said they can only give a discount on the rate when it is reserved, not once it’s already rented. For better customer retention, wouldn’’t it be better to take care of the customers you already have instead of penalizing them? Very disappointed, very unprofessional, shady and underhanded policy. The answer via representative via phone and chat, said “this is system generated and we cannot change it”. Such a feeble excuse in 2022’s technology because programming could change this, therefore Fox Rental Cars CHOOSE NOT TOO. and TAKE ADVANTAGE to get more money out of their existing customers. They say they “are sorry but will tell you it’s on their website and on the rental agreement you sign”, and of course, it is, it’s in the FINE PRINT.  What about full disclosure at the rental counter of charges like this that might impact the customer at the time you are at the rental counter? I won’t be back at Fox Rental Cars, unless they credit me $190. I can understand a rate change per day by a little but not a huge increase perhaps, but not a fee that is simply screwing THEIR customer because you have them and they have little choice.",1,CA,"June 10, 2022"
"Maria was super helpful in upgrading my vehicle, my wife left her phone in the vehicle at drop of the staff helped me search the vehicle until we found it 5 stars for sure!",5,US,"June 10, 2022"
"Veronica is awesome, we were in line waiting and she quickly took the next customer waiting at the line, she realized that an associate was solving an issue that took a long time and left what she was doing to take care of us too.She explained and answered our questions about coverage and save us a lot of money by explaining the plate pass toll program since we had to go from San Francisco to Oakland and Sausalito several daysGreat employee!",5,N/A,"June 10, 2022"
"Let me express my frustration regarding Fox rental cars. Although the confirmation stated that everything was paid for and settled and we didn't have to pay anything more when we picked up the car, we had to pay extra taxes, a deposit and a full petrol tank. All in all, about 400$ extra! In addition, the extra insurance that we had paid with you with the reservation turned out to be invalid according to the official because it was from a third party and we would be insured for nothing if we did not pay another insurance that he proposed to me on the spot. He also tried to tell me that you can't drive through California without an EZ pass which you also have to buy from him. Fortunately I know better, but my confidence was already completely gone at that point.Although we arrived two hours later than planned it turned out that the car was not ready and we would have to wait another half hour, but if we did not want that we could get a smaller car right away. When I said I would wait for the car I had paid for it turned out to be miraculously available anyway. With every car I've rented in the past you pick it up full of gas and you bring it back full of gas. Here you have to pay extra for a full tank and you can bring it back empty, so to speak. No one does this of course, which does a nice job of improving Fox's revenue model.All in all, this was my worst customer experience ever!",1,US,"June 10, 2022"
Fox is efficient and the people are nice.  The difference is the cars are older and higher mileage.  But they are clean and seem to be well serviced.  But you save money so that has to weigh into your equation.,4,US,"June 09, 2022"
"Friendly people, reasonable rates, charges explained to me with no pressure. Overall great experience!",5,US,"June 09, 2022"

Fox rent a car did it right this time! I had rented in the past from Fox with mixed experience but this time I give them a 10! From the agent who helped us change to a hybrid to the quick check out. It was great!,5,IN,"May 27, 2022"
It was a smooth rental experience with great support and guidance from team. I am one of their proud happy customer.,5,US,"June 02, 2022"
The rental experience was great except for a misunderstanding when I checked in to get the vehicle.  I had arranged to pick it up at 5 pm on May 27 but arrived much earlier from Boston so asked if I could have the car earlier.  She said yes but to have it back by 5 pm on May 30 or I would be charged a day extra.  I didn't realize I was already paying for an extra day because of being early.  I returned the car much earlier than 5.,5,SE,"May 27, 2022"
"The most horrible experience I have ever had with a rental car company. The first car had squeaking breaks, the wheel pulled to the left, no iso-fix for the carseat, very small trunk space and roaches (2). I had to drive all the way back to Miami to return it for these reasons only later to find out that it could have been returned at any fox rental center, however I had been misinformed by the representative I spoke with. Not to mention Miami was a 4 hour drive from where we were staying. The manager seemed to be unmoved by my concerns but did end up giving me a larger vehicle with better trunk space and iso-fix for the carseat to connect. However when I tell you the replacement car was even worse than the previous one that's a complete understatement. There were foot prints on the windshield from where the previous passenger had had their feet up meaning it was never cleaned, the back of the passenger headrest had grease stains so that had not been cleaned or wiped down either, the windshield wiper fluid was not wiper fluid at all but WATER and therefor did absolutely nothing!!! The passenger window never rolled down, the breaks were also squeaky on this car but not only that the steering wheel shook violently when stepping on the breaks so that break pads had not been changed in god knows how long! Completely unsafe! And last but not least the front right headlight was out which we discovered day 2 of driving the vehicle. I really can't make this stuff up. I could have easily returned the car for a third vehicle but I was afraid that one might have a wheel pop off while driving. It was obvious the quality of the vehicles supplied to customers so it was meaningless to even try. Needless to say it was the worse experience of my life and I would never recommend nor use FOX rental cars again.",1,US,"June 02, 2022"
We are happy we went through Fox to rent a car! Liya worked with us at the counter and she was lovely. So kind and helpful! We will definitely use Fox again.,5,N/A,"May 24, 2022"

"Tuesday May 31, 2022 Good Afternoon Team! I wanted to take a moment and let you know that as someone who regularly provides reviews online, that I would simply state the following to the American Public who travels regularly. You all need to understand the following. 1. This is an off-airport location and you must take a shuttle to an off airport site. 2. The reason that you are even doing business with Fox Rent A Car is that they offer inexpensive rental rates, without fail. Now with that in mind, and the fact that rental cars in 2022 are being priced in some markets as much as 10x pre Covid-19, you have to admit… you simply wanted the deal…. Thus the results you are presenting here and your subsequent commentary. My experience was simple. As the CEO and President of A Large company, I deal with client service matters daily. I made the CHOICE to book with Fox Rent a Car… I am a Presidential Isle member at Avis, and diamond and platinum at all other agencies, including private jet rentals (Net Jets) however,  I made the same decision you did to rent from Fox, even after reading the reviews. Based on this decision, I spoke to the site manager in Salt Lake City, Roselynn and her associate Alex, whom both have exceptional customer service skills. How was I able to create such a pleasant outcome? I presented myself at the rental counter and was calm... And not demanding or entitled. I did not make demands, but merely relaxed and picked up my car, thus the entire Salt Lake City staff mirrored my gratitude and I was given a 5 star treatment. Note that during the booking, review and vetting process of the Company, I read the reviews All of them. I even researched the CEO Mike Jaberi, who is based out of Los Angeles. I knew that it was MY obligation to DOCUMENT any and all prior damage to the vehicle, (done using an IPHONE 13 PRO MAX WITH 4k digital quality 102 Photos) as well as to ensure that it was agreed by and between the parties that the car had not been smoked in. Once all of the photos and documents were completed, I left feeling like a valued client. The bottom line is that if you want 5 star service, you MUST provide that same 5 star customer that they, as a Corporation, are looking for. Believe me, they want your business, and I am sure the management team nationwide would spend thousands per client if each client were able to create a win between the Company and the Customer. WE SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR ON CLIENT AND CORPORATE ACQUISITION. IN CONCLUSION, If you follow my instructions, you will be guaranteed success in all of your transactions, READ THIS AT LEAST 3 TIMES BEFORE WRITING A NEGATIVE REVIEW, and ALWAYS document the facts (previous damage) as if you are an attorney going to Court. I am proud to be a repeat client of Fox Rent A Car! Again, thanks Roz and Alex! To your success, Robert Paisola President and CEO Western Capital International 1-800-373-8913 x 702 Cc: Mike Jaberi via LinkedIn, Los Angeles",5,CH,"June 01, 2022"
"My transatlantic flight was cancelled due to technical issues, so I got to the car rental 24h later. Fox Rent A Car had already declared a no-show on my reservation as their holdup time is max 12h, even if you alert them beforehand. They refused to update the booking and instead they charged the full amount. In essence, I was robbed the equivalent of an 8-day car rental.  How is that an honest customer-oriented policy? The hotel, Home2Suits by Hilton, on the contrary, had a much smarter and honest policy. They immediately updated the reservation with the new dates when I explained the reason for the late arrival. If you want to spare yourself this kind of destructive frustration and being ripped off, please stay away from FoxRentACar and its umbrella corporation, Europcar Mobility Group.",1,US,"May 31, 2022"

"Location - Its away from the airport. You go to the car rental centere at the airport and take their shuttle there. OR..take a cab to the locationStaff: Excellent Manager. He allowed me to exchange the car I had been previously given so I got a bigger one. Also, I left my phone in the previous car and rushed back after 2 hours and he had kept it for me. Also, the lady who checks the cars back in when you return them and shuttle driver are nice. Condition of the car: Fantastic. No complaints.  I would definitely rent from them again. Like many have said the location is not the best but...they have alot of other things that make up for it",5,US,"May 23, 2022"
Fox staff Lani at the San Diego airport pick-up venue was extremely helpful in adjusting our bookings without us have to incur unnecessary increases in fees.Fox needs to upgrade their website to allow for easy changes online without customers incurring change fees.,4,US,"May 11, 2022"
"we didn't have any problems with the rental, except that they try to up sell you on everything. The problems occurred when I left my cell phone behind in the car. I called their number immediately that evening when I realized it. That was Saturday night. It is now Tuesday and all 5 of my phone calls have been in vain. You leave information and they say someone will call you back. Nothing. I know I left the phone, but I am not the only person who has left something behind. They just don't care about the customers after the rental is over.",1,US,"May 31, 2022"
"We rented out a nice, clean vehicle from Fox Rent a Car at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. The man who helped us out with our vehicle, Emilio, was very nice and even gave us some water bottles for our trip because he knew the weather would be 90+ degrees during our road trip! It was really thoughtful of him and gave us a great impression about this business. Overall, we had a good experience with Fox Rent A Car's service.",5,US,"May 31, 2022"
"Was very satisfied with the service. Anthony was really courteous, knowledgeable and friendly. He really took good care of us. Loved the vehicle he provided us. He understood our needs and took care of us accordingly. Fox should have more employees like him.Did have some issues with the line formation during shuttle pickup to the airport but it's not Fox it's ppl cutting lines. Would really like less shuttle duration between pickups to avoid chaos. Overall satisfied.",4,US,"May 21, 2022"
"I didn't know what to expect when renting from Fox. The prices were on the economical side so I was expecting the entire experience to be ""less than."" I definitely made a mistake in my way of thinking! I totally was blown away by every Fox Associate I interacted with. Everyone tried their best to makse sure I had a good experience. From the shuttle driver to the attendant who took the car back at check-out, EVERYONE had a smile on their face and worked seamlessly to get what we needed! I will definitely be using FOX again!",5,US,"May 19, 2022"
"Mazda SUV - great car!  Good gas mileage, plenty of space, downshift for mountain driving.",4,US,"May 30, 2022"
Pick up from LAX to get to the pick up location took a looooong time. More than 20 minutes. Staff were all wonderful and were kind to my crying child.Vehicle was clean but worn. Tires weren't properly balanced. Easy to return and quick return trip to the airport.Good overall and would give them another try based on pricing.,4,US,"May 15, 2022"
"We had a great experience with Fox. Very easy and smooth with both getting the car and dropping it off. The gentleman that helped up was kind, funny and helpful. Even with it being late at night to pick up, he kept a great attitude",5,US,"May 24, 2022"
I purchased a trip package from Priceline flight and car rental. When I arrived to pickup the vehicle the attendant informed me that Fox did not do third party rentals and if I wanted a car I would have to pay again for the vehicle. The rude Women Quiniata refused even check to see if I was correct. This Company is a rip off I have already file a complaint with the BBB and the California Attorney Generals Office for consumer fraud.,1,US,"May 28, 2022"

First off I didnt know they don't take debit cards untill I came at car. I take my debit card when I travel. Secondly the airline cancelled my flight so I couldn't change reservation.

It was a horrible experience so I went to Alamo where customer service was great!!!!,2,N/A,"May 27, 2022"

"Don't prepay for fuel, no matter what they say, you pay full tank.  They tell you they will credit for fuel in tank.  It's a lie.",4,US,"May 27, 2022"
Overall it was a decent experience the only thing that you might wanna be careful about is the gas you sign in papers so fast you don’t have time to read you pay to pre-fueled your car already so I ended up filling it up with gas before I brought it back realizing after I got the receipt that they had already included gas.,4,HU,"May 27, 2022"
"Basically everything was OK, the staff, the car (clean and very good condition), you have just be careful with the offers presented, as in the csse of car companies. But this one was a good choice. My experience was good, I would recommend. Only I would pay for roadside assistance, if driving those deserted roads again.",5,GB,"May 18, 2022"
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! They are rip off merchants. Make out all their costs are clear and then add them on. I specifically asked if it was the total amount all in, to which the associate said yes, and then the final invoice was double for extension fees and insurances. On the phone, they said that was included with the price quoted. Do yourself a favor and use folk that aren't con artists. I thought I was paying approximately $360. Ended up being $600+!",1,US,"May 26, 2022"
Missy and CJ at the Burbank airport location were the most professional and friendly associates that I have ever encountered.

"Worst rental car experience EVER!  Yes, they will be cheaper than all the other companies, but if you have a problem, you not only will wait on hold for a very long time, but you will get no satisfaction.  I rented one of their Jeep Wranglers for a 2 week stay, and it ended up with a DEATH WOBBLE (google it).  After many calls, and being sent to the wrong repair places, they finally brought me a different Jeep Wrangler.  Guess what!  It ALSO had a death wobble.  I've since learned this is a maintenance issue with these vehicles and the death wobble is a KNOWN problem.  All in all the problems ended up costing me over $300 additional dollars and NO ONE.....not ONE person who can make a decision will return a phone call of email to even discuss this.  You should not rent from the, even to save a few dollars.",1,US,"May 22, 2022"

Return guy did his check and said all good. Then emailed me a new unsigned agreement for $60 more with no reason.

every thing was fine except the long wait time at the airport for a fox shuttle bus. I watch all the other rental car companies come by at least three times before I see  a fox shuttle bus and the first one I saw refused to stop and pick me up even though his bus wasnt full and I was anxiously waving him over. waiting at the lax airport for a fox shuttle bus alway is apprx a half hour wait,4,US,"May 06, 2022"

"Absolutely horrible customer service.  I made a rental for my business.  I sent two people to pick up the car.  The sole driver is 26, but did not have a credit card.  They made the person who did have a credit card, the driver.  I originally got a quote for $398.23.  They then charged a surcharge for the new driver who is not 25 and charged a new amount of $940.89.  They will not work with us.  Customer service can't answer questions and simply says, ""sorry this is the policy"".  Worst car rental company I have ever worked with",1,US,"May 17, 2022"
"Zero Rating.  Do NOT USE THIS COMPANY! I was told by the agent at Orlando counter that I did not need to fill up the tank upon return of car, because Fox charges LESS than gas in the area. Fox charges $4.18 per gallon. Therefore, I returned the car THREE-QUARTERS FULL after using only 4 gallons total on my trip and allowed Fox to fill the tank. When I received my bill, it was for $55.00 in gas!!!!  I only drove 100 miles total! and the tank read THREE-QUARTERS FULL!  When I called Fox customer service, they told me, ""you signed the contract. there's nothing we can do."" I told them Fox in Orlando Misreported the gas usage and overcharged me a massive amount - for a Toyota Corolla! I asked to speak to Orlando agent, but they said we don't have a PHONE NUMBER for the location. THIS IS FRAUD!!!  I asked for a callback from a manager. They took  my number down.  It is completely DISHONEST.  They also upcharged me $12.00 a day for a pass by scaring me about Toll charges, providing a worst case scenario, when in fact local toll charges were only a few dollars.  The car had water stains on the seats in front and back and a squeaky window.  What a rip-off this company is - at least the office in Orlando. DO NOT USE THEM.",1,GB,"May 16, 2022"
"Check the car and photo every little dent or scratch, these guys are out to get you when you return the car, be very careful if you collect your car after dark as not all damage will be visible.

I truly wish that I could provide this company with 0 stars. I canceled my booking after feeling uneasy about the whole experience after reading other's reviews.

Stay away from this place!!!! Rented through a third party who emailed us in black and white saying we had $0.00 to pay at the pickup counter after already paying $650 online and had to pay it again when we picked it up!!! Complete scam I put my credit card in the machine and then the woman explained we had to pay another $650 and she put it through before I even said yes to it!! Will be taking further action against these fraudsters read everyone else's reviews aswell. GREEDY SCAMMERS STAY AWAY WONT ANSWER MY EMAILS ASWELL!,1,GB,"May 05, 2022"
DO NOT HIRE FROM HERE! Booked a car a couple days ago and picked it up today to find out we actually had to pay DOUBLE what we were quoted online. On our booking confirmation email it specifically says ‘Total pay at pickup: $0.00’ as we had already paid online. When we get there we had to pay an additional $650! It was a terrible start to our holiday. They are complete scammers and do this to trick you into forcing you to pay way more than you were originally told. It is devious and bad business. I am going to further dispute this charge and perhaps take legal action as this is fraud. There is written confirmation that I did not have to pay any additional charges however they have charged me nonetheless. Daylight robbery.,1,US,"May 04, 2022"
Wish I could give zero stars. Rude staff smoking cigarettes right next to customers. Nasty manager. High mileage dirty vehicle. Extra charges on return. A rental car nightmare to ruin your trip cThis was Salt Lake City location,1,IE,"April 29, 2022"
"Stay away from Fox. I recently rented a car for 880 dollars for two weeks in Orlando. I was told that within the original price, insurance etc were covered. Only after I returned the car did I find out I was being charged an additional charge of 26.99 per day x15 and rental car liability charge x15. This amounted to an extra 681 dollars. I specifically told Livia behind the counter in the Orlando location that i did not want any additional add ons to my booking. Have tried to contact their customer service but no response. Stay away at all costs!!!!",1,GB,"April 28, 2022"
Arrived at rental to pick up car with confirmation of payment and written in black and white no further payments - they proceeded to charge me over the same amount again - have attempted to contact there customer service 3 times but appears to be no customer service - also had to wait at airport for well over an hour to be collected.,1,IE,"April 28, 2022"
"AVOID!! Really poor service, ordered a car for 5 people and when we pitched up at desk they said we hadn't and charged an extra 200 dollars for a bigger car.  Complaint made but they couldn't care less. Seems like good value when you book online but doubled in price on arrival to pick up car with 'upgrade' and various extras.",1,US,"April 28, 2022"

"Update: in their reply below, Fox suggests I contact an email address that I had already repeatedly sent messages to 3 days ago, *still with zero replies*!!Yesterday my husband and I returned the car we had rented back to Fox's Denver Airport location. We returned it about an hour earlier than indicated in our rental agreement. Today I saw a $150 extra charge to my credit card. Fox’s billing office told me that the Denver location did not properly check in our return, and apparently it is showing in the system as an open rental, accruing late fees!  I’ve called every Fox number I can find and yet no one has been able to resolve this. Alarming and infuriating.",1,US,"April 26, 2022"

"Brilliant car and 1st rate service from Fox. We rented the vehicle in March. The hire cost was a lot cheaper than it’s rivals and some of the reviews did make me a little concerned about what to expect but couldn’t be more wrong. We hired a SUV from LAX and the staff were so friendly and professional. The car itself was brand new and faultless. I upgraded to the next model up and it was only an extra $10 a day. We did incur a toll penalty (even though I had registered for FasTrack) but to be fair to Fox, the administration fee was only $15 dollars. Would definitely use them again.",5,US,"April 24, 2022"
"Absolutely zero regard for safety.  Fox rent a car is literally renting accidents waiting to happen. We rented our vehicle in February, only to find out when it snowed on I 70 west that the wiper pump did not operate, requiring us to stop the vehicle and squirt water on the windshield, washing it manually. Worse, the car spun out and I 70 spinning five or six times down the highway is a result of the tires having two millimeters of tread, which is completely unlawful.  We could not use the rental car the entire trip as it could not make it up a small grade. Fox would not stand behind its product, and the tire companies informed us that this was common, and when Fox would advise the customer to fix the tires for them (effectively perform maintenance on the vehicles they neglected) they would stiff them. Please avoid this foreign company at all cost. There is a reason Hertz and Avis are more expensive.  If you want to bring your family back home alive that is…",1,GB,"April 23, 2022"
I recently rented a car from fox in Orlando which I paid for through wise car. The car was paid for up front as was the insurance. On collection I was offered an upgrade as I would be using the car as my daughters wedding car I gladly accepted the upgrade as at the time it seemed very cheap.During my time with this car we had several torrential downpours with much rain water leaking in through the roof .On one such occasion my daughters dress got soaked.I complained about this and I was told I would receive recompense. However on return home I received a huge bill for rental of both cars and insurance with no recompense. I have sent many emails to the management and not one single reply.Terrible terrible service,1,GB,"April 22, 2022"
"Picked up our car from Orlando, all went well except when we retuned the car, after getting off a long flight home, we have been charged extra $300+ dollars for additional insurance. When collecting the car we specifically said that we didn't want any insurance. As previous reviewers have indicated, you sign blank screens. The same happened to my father-in-law for his rental with Fox. Very poor and will be expecting this money to be retuned.",1,US,"April 22, 2022"
Worst experience renting a car. This was in Madrid spain I rented through travelocity and was a total scam they required an international driver license which was not in the information provided when I booked. To make things worse I think the license was an excuse because they didn't have the car I booked and wanted to give me a compact car when I needed and booked a van. Just don't avoid the frustrations and waste of time....,1,US,"April 21, 2022"
"I would give a 0 if if could. Check in process at Phoenix airport desk was absolutely awful. The line up stretched right across the terminal and moved v slowly. Only had 2 people working at the desk. It would have taken an hour and a half to check in, fortunately we worked out that we had checked in online and could go straight to car pick up. No information about this, so we wasted about half an hour. I felt really bad for all the people we left in the line. Will never rent from them again",1,US,"April 19, 2022"
"my flight was cancelled and Fox did not have a car for my alternate date. because I paid UP FRONT they have KEPT my $373 plus$150 deposit because they said I was a BUY NOW customer, which meant there was no return for paying ahead of time. I would say a cancelled flight and no cars to rent was BEYOND MY CONTROL and should be reimbursed, its not like we just didnt want the car! I will not stop with this review, I will continue to give bad reviews and explanations as long as i have to.  The offer of $373 credit and NO mention of what happened to my $150 deposit is UNACCEPTABLE",1,US,"April 17, 2022"
"Booked the vehicle on Priceline for 500. They charged over 900 almost doubling the cost of the rental. They charged two or three extra fees not mentioned by priceline. I book another with Hertz a month later and the cost was exactly what Priceline had quoted. Fox Car Rental is definately Bait and Switch, they quote a low price on priceline and jack it up when you try to pick up the car.",1,US,"April 15, 2022"
"I rented a ""Fox Rent a Car"" car through rentalcars.com for $300 at their Denver airport offsite location. They snuck in an extra $500 for insurance that I didn't ask for. I didn't see it until I received the receipt when I returned the car. Fox Rent A Car in Denver has deceptive practices when signing their contract. Their representative does not present the contract to you and has you sign a blank digital pad where they take your signature and add it to a contract that they don't show you. I have never been to a car rental place that does this. The representative I spoke to did not tell me he was adding insurance to my purchase, and he never showed me his computer screen. He could have altered the contract after the fact for all I know. Moreover, the initials under the insurance section do not match the initials for the rest of the signatures.I reached out to their email they have plastered all over their review responses, ""billing at foxrentacar.com"", numerous times, the last time being February 2, 2022. I have not received a response from them since January 31, 2022. They are unresponsive. Do not bother with this company, you'll end up paying more in the end with them.EDIT: I called the number the merchant provided in a response to this review. Apparently, I was supposed to receive a deposit refund of $252 that Fox Rent A Car never refunded me. My credit card company has no record of receiving this on March 4 as Fox Rent A Car claims. It wasn't until I called numerous times did Fox Rent A Car finally refund that amount to my card on April 19. The representative told me they would call me back about the extra insurance charge for $246 within 3 business days. We're on business day number 4 now with no call back. What a hassle.EDIT 2: Customer service never called me back. I had to call them again, and it took a complaint to the BBB to get this resolved. I finally received a refund.",1,N/A,"April 13, 2022"
"Rented the car for 13 days, car was due back at 5:00pm on the 13th day, brought it back 2:30 pm, 2.5 Hours early, they automatically charged me $20 for early return!!! Said I could dispute in counter that was backed up out the door. Terrible !!!",1,US,"April 12, 2022"
"I rented a car at the Phoenix Sky Harbor location using airline miles.  The staff at the rental counter were very helpful and that part of the transaction went smoothly.  The rental was suppose to be pickup up at 4:30 pm.  Because of the airlines and bus service I was late in picking the car up.  The pickup time was 5:12pm.   Car car was clean and the process went well getting out of the airpark vicinity. I had booked the rental for 11 days however I returned the car 3 days earlier.  Return went well.  Staff told be I would get a return emailed to me, never received that.  A couple of weeks later I was reviewing my credit card statement and found that Fox had charged my account $79.01.  I called customer service and was told that was a fee for picking the car up 42 minutes late.  Are you kidding me.  Was I going to get anything back for returning the car 3 days early?  After a lengthy argument Fox said that they would refund my account.  Unbelievable!",1,US,"April 12, 2022"
I am very dissatisfied with Fox Rental in Los Angeles. They refused to honor the Jeep Grand Cherokee even though there were Cherokee Grands available. They offered me a Mitsubishi Outlander that was a sub-par vehicle. Not anywhere comparable or similar to the Jeep Grand Cherokee. They directed me to section 11 that contained only heavily used and worn vehicles. When I questioned the Fleet Managet about it he became somewhat hostile in nature. He informed me that I had reserved the older Jeep Grand Cherokee and that I could not have the newer ones because they had more seats. I instantly knew that Fox was telling me lies to capture an upgrade. I did upgrade paying more so that my children would be safe. I hold Priceline Fox and Booking.com for unethical business practices that may be systemic and illegal. I would like a refund for the amount they charged for an  upgrade or I will refer your practices to the US District Attorney's office. Obviously their business tactics are by design and who knows what an in depth investigation will uncover.,1,US,"April 10, 2022"
I reserved a car from Fox for the end of May for 6 days. no changes no cancellation Im fine with that I called and asked to combine a 1 day rental at todays rates to my existing rental . I was told that I would need to drive back to the air port the next day to sign a new contract. I work with clients daily. Obviously Ill use another company for my 1 day rental instead of putting more money in this companies pocket. there is no reason I could not sign both contracts at the same time. unacceptable customer service.,1,PL,"April 05, 2022"
"Don't rent any vehicles from this company! I booked a car on rentalcars.com and payed everything. When I came to FOX rent to pick up the car, they said that I have to pay extra incurance which is mandatory. I was arguing that I have all insurance and I don't have to buy extra one but they didn't want to give me a car. If I wanted to pick up the car I had to buy insurance and instead of paying 400$ I payed more than 800$. After signing the documents, it turned out that the insurance was not compulsory but I couldn't do anything. I do not recommend this company completely.",1,GB,"April 01, 2022"
"I’ve just had the same unfortunate experience as a previous reviewer in that I was scammed in to purchasing insurance in Orlando which I stated I did not want. They blow the screen up so you can only see the signature page and given that I had told the employee I did not want the insurance, I trusted him to follow my request. Instead he ripped me off and my $425 weekly hire became $900! The gentleman also said to bring the car back without fuel as they only charge you for what you’ve used. This is also not true as I took it back 3/4 full and was charged for half a tank. The standard reply to all of these complaints is that they’re happy to ‘review the rental agreement’, (which as I mentioned, they con you in to signing by enlarging the screen to show just the signature box). It’s a blatant SCAM and I am disgusted with this company’s underhand antics.This shoddy outfit is a disgrace and should be avoided at all costs.",1,US,"March 30, 2022"
"Tried dropping off a rental car back to them when I had a flight out that morning on Saturday. Swung by and no one was there around 545 am. The office was closed but no one was there early to even take the car at all and I didn't want to miss my flight out for a 720 am. When the office finally opened I called when I was waiting for the plane and was thru security and tried to explain to the customer service representative on the phone about this and they didn't want to listen at all. They didn't want to try and work with me on this. Was never told about how to drop it off the car when picking it up. When the person finally said fine we will tell the office there and I gave the number of the spot to the person on the phone to have someone that day come by to pick it up. They never did since I got a call a week later which they never picked up due to not finding the spot. I even told them on the phone originally I have photos to show and let them know that. Now they are wanting to charge $600 on top of a pre-paid reservation thru Priceline I was already charged $250 with no receipt showing why, which I am disputing all of the charges due to this and now they are going to send me to collections since they didn't want to work with me on any of this at all and didn't want to listen since they only care about getting their money. So being in Hospitality myself there are things that should be considered and not be charged at all. None of the people that I have spoken to HAVEN'T been helpful or even understanding, the last person I spoke to said that it wasn't their fault and I have to paid this. On top of all of this they never returned a phone call even when I left messages. The only time they have called now is to collect on the amount which shouldn't be at all. Also the shuttle driver to take us there in the beginning wasn't really nice at all which I wish I had a choice thru Priceline I would have changed the place I was going for my rental. I really don't recommend them at all since this has ended badly.",1,US,"March 29, 2022"

We took what they offered only to realize it would not work for us.  We tried for 2 hours to get in contact with someone at the location and were told the only way to speak with someone at the location was to drive back 45 minutes.  It is ridiculous that there is no phone number to the location itself.   They did give us an ""upgrade"" but sure weren't friendly.",2,NL,"March 28, 2022"
Do not rent a car at this company they are awful. I booked a car through Discovercars showing Europcar eventually it was Fox in Orlando near MCO.- Staff is very rude- They tried to charge $400 more than we booked for.- We received 3 cars before we were able to leave with a normal car. The first one was basic we booked full size. The second one smelled like weed. The 3rd one had a small trunk. After 2 hours we finally received a car we booked. Still outdated but we we’re tired of waiting as we also had a 12h flight. I’m still waiting on my refundable security deposit.,1,GB,"March 26, 2022"
"I had made a booking through Orbitz for a car collected from Orland Florida close to the airport. That booking didn’t include any type of insurance as I had a separate one. On the day of collection, the lady who assisted me asked me if I wanted to add insurance and I told her no, explaining that I am covered already. Without me realising it as I was never explained this, she added insurance. When she asked me to use my credit card, she told me that that was for the security deposit and not to make the final payment for the reservation. She told me to sign at different stages but it was never cleared to me that I was also purchasing insurance. Trusting her job, I did everything I was asked to, I got the keys and left. On the day I returned the car, I was expecting to pay for my booking as I was told I would pay at the end of it. When I dropped the car, the gentleman cho checked the car and collected back the keys, answered to my question that everything was completed and I was ready to leave and have me taken to the airport. I then checked my emails and realised I was charged nearly double the amount of my original booking! I went back to the office and asked to speak to the manager. I was there for nearly 45 minutes. I was told that I should have checked my email from the beginning and checked what the lady had me sign and charged. She is right! I should have! It was my mistake that I had trusted the employee! When she was asked to explain what had happened, the employee who had originally served me lied in front of my face saying that I told that my insurance doesn’t cover the rental! Then why didn’t I add it at the first place? I offered to show to them my contract with a third party company. They declined my offer! Long story short and after a long and unpleasant conversation, they agreed to refund me approximately 70% of the added value they had charged me, but never agreed to refund me the total amount of the insurance I never verbally agreed as I was never explained at the first place. I was fully trusting the employee and I shouldn’t have! But the manager, should have the capacity to understand a customer who speaks the truth versus someone who is trying to get away with things! Utterly horrible experience and at the last minute. I don’t understand why you don’t accept payment on day one, so that misunderstandings can be avoided! But I guess another mistake I made was not to read all the negative reviews beforehand and get myself prepared to deal with people like them! Shame on them!!!",1,US,"March 25, 2022"
Rented with Fox In Nov 2021 &March 2022. Never an issue. Quick & easy. You will be asked to upgrade. Just say no if you don't want it. I always pay for what i want during booking online. 5 stars all the way!,5,US,"March 23, 2022"
When registering to pickup the car the agent informed me they did not accept my credit card insurance coverage and the extra would be $36/day. He tried to tell me it was Mexica law that my credit card could not be used.  I told him that was not true as I had rented previously from other companies and never had an issue. He then pulled out a crumpled printed sheet and said it was their policy. There was no mention of this when making the booking.I left and will never book with Fox again.

Lengthy queues late at night, repeatedly told the advisor that I did not need insurance, this was added anyway, was misadvised that the only way to pay for toll roads was by taking out their daily subscription, this is false, you can pay online. Don't bother contacting them they don't reply. The correct way to complain is via the department of consumer and business affairs in California, I can't post a link but Google them, there is an online complaints service.

"Worst company ever! I did an online reservation and chose ""PAY NOW"". The correct amount of $204 was charged to my card. I get there WITH reservation in hand and they didn't use it. They created a new reservation instore and lied about ALL charges. Repeatedly they said that refueling was 3.45 a gallon and I was charged $7.99 a gallon. I also upgraded my car which was an additional $89 and added a toll pass for $83 for the week. My original reservation which I prepaid for was $204 + $89 for the upgrade, plus $83 for the toll pass which equals $376. They then charged a different card with the amount of the reservation THEY MADE in store when I had my prepaid reservation that they didn't use. Now I have $204 being charged to one card and $629 carded to another. SCAMMERS to say the least. I have been calling and trying to get this situation fixed but they keep trying to adjust the reservasion THEY MADE in store and not the pre paid reservation I made 2 weeks in advance.

I disputed the fraudulent charge with USAA. Fox told USAA I'd returned the car with the tank empty. I was very careful to return the car over half full, as I'd prepaid for a half tank of gas. Am I supposed to take a picture of the gas gauge with a time and date stamp?!?!The 7 March reply from Fox led me to make 2 additional attempts to get Fox to resolve the issue, but that only resulted in additional frustration and time wasted.

"This entire company is a scam. First off, they tried to talk us into a car upgrade by lying about the type of car we rented.  When, I had the exact car we rented on my expedia agreement. They try and talk you into these extra fees that you do not need.  They told us we would pass through enough tolls to warrant a $11 a day to purchase a daily toll pass.  This was not true so we removed the pass.  Then we had $5 in tolls at the end of the trip and they are trying to charge us $90 in ""administrative fees"". These extra fees make them as expensive as the non budget rental companies. They'll cover up this scam by telling you ""it was in the rental agreement you sign"".  The rental agreement was never given to us in a way that you could read it.   Only on a very small signature pad. This is not how a morally sound company runs.

"Be aware I would nevet rent a car from them again was a nightmare cost me over double what I had agreement for! They will scam you anyway they can! First my flight was postponed for a day due to lack of pilots so I called and changed the rental for following day! The  next day i arrived at Tampa airport and there was not one person there in line at 10:30 am but took them over an hr to give me a car! They said they didnt have the car i specifically reserved and needed for the purpose of my trip! They then said they couldnt use paperwork on reaervation and had to make a whole new one which ended up a higher price than what I rented it on thrU expedia which was not only cheaper but was for four days to begin with and this was only for three days and was more! Then, I got a small compact with no leg room for my husband was cramped and had a four hr drive! The car was dirty on inside and i pointed it out to the man who did walk around and they want you to sign paper about condition of car! I told him i didnt want to sign because inside was not clean and i didnt want to be held responsible looked like someone smoked inside and if there were any burn holes i wouldnt be responsible! I did look and didnt see burn holes and by this point we were already late so i signed and he said dont worry they only care about the outside for damage! I said i always clean car before i return it and obviously this one wasnt cleaned! He said oh you do not have to worry and i said really that is good to know because I have a four he drive to make my plane next day so if i hit traffic and dont have time to vaccuum I am ok? Yes he said! So on way back we hit accident and we got to airport cutting it close but I could have stopped to vaccuum but the car was in same shape as when we got it so we decided to not stop to vacuum and just get into terminal. We hadnt even put the car in park nor had I even got my belongings out of car and a large black man pushes the young girl aside and starts telling me we have to pay 500 dollars for smoking in the car! I looked at him like he was some nut! We never smoked in car in fact my husband cant stand the smell of smoke and would nevet ever let anyone smoke around him let alone in a compact car! I asked the man why he accused us falsely and he said there were ashes in the car and he had to take it off lot to fumagate it! I said show me because the car was dirty when we picked it up but I couldnt tell if it was ashes or sand or dirt! He wouldnt show me and i said i have time i didnt have to return car until two more hrs. i did have a flight to catch but I could have run to corner and vacuumed it and sprayed with ionizer! Then i would have take  it to another rental place like hertz to verify the car was clean and had no smell he claimed it had! But he refused! I called company headquarters and complained he instantly had charged my card! They said they would look into it and week later Theh said they had pictures and I said show me! They sent email with no pictures that would open never saw any pictures! I called my credit card company! They reversed charges! Suddenly months later the charges were put back on with no explanation! I belief the black man was prejudice because he ran over and took over processing the car before i even got out but my husband had gotten out and he has long hair! We were wearing concert clothes because we were at a four day music festival and had to leave by 4 am to make it from daytona to Tampa and hadnt showered or slept we had a bon fire at friends place was a cold night. Little did they know we were not some smoking hippi losers! I have a masters degree and he owns a successful high end business for 30 yrs! So I paid 1000 dollars for three day rental of a compact car! They were very rude to us! They had no customers and now we know why!!! Do not rent from Fox not worth it! I rent in Fl at least three times a year never had any issues ever!!!!! First time I rented from cheaper place and wished I hadn't!! I just received an email with Fox Rental car's response to my review that stated so sorry and to contac them! Are you serious Fox rental car is that your automated response to all your negative reviews! Not only did I contact Fox more than once when this occurred including the minute I left the rude man who charged my cc without my permission, my credit card company tried to resolve this issue with your company and also got no where! It is a joke to you to take a hard working person's 500 dollars on top of the additional money you already scammed on top of the agreed original contract! Ruined a vacation budgeted during a time where financially american's are struggling! But you believe that someone should be charged 500 dollars for a car they didnt reaerve and was given to them dirty and it was noted during walk around and it will cost you 500 dollars to vacuum it and spray some ionizer spray would take you 15 mins to clean and cost you with labor what 10 dollars!

Customer service horrendous after many attempts to contact through email I ended up having calling their customer service number which cost me £36 to be told my car reservation doesn't exist even though I received a confirmation email with booking reference.  Seems to be a scam they obviously got a better price for car I had booked as apparently they have no cars available on the dates I need.

Recently rented a SUV from fox at Orlando international airport. Everything went fin at start or so I thought. I arrived on a flight from the uk traveling over 9 hours. We get pick up at the airport all is good get to the rental shop again all is good. We go through the process of renting the vehicle and get asked if we would like any other product from them tells them NO as we have already paid for extra protection/insurance for the vehicle with Wise who we book through. So all is good signs for the vehicle and drives away. Cars find whole time. Arrived back at fox at the end of the agreement and gets shuttle back to it airport only then as I check my credit card do I realise they have charged me 363$ for LDW that I did not as for nor did I want. Now they did not charge my credit card for this while i was I Orlando only when they knew I was at the airport so that way I could not question why they had charged me for a product I didn’t not want. This company Is very sly in the way they put extra charges on you without you knowing. Iv since tried to contact them for refunds and such but get no reply. Terrible company. Please beware and stay away.,1,US,"January 31, 2022"
"I rented a car from Fox Phoenix. Very rude customer service associate. I was told 3 different totals, each one higher than the first. I had pre booked my car through a program at my work, and when I pulled up the original quote, it was almost $300 less. I felt like he was attempting to take advantage of me since I was a woman traveling with my daughter. The car was decent, but the oil change light was on the entire 4 days I had it.",2,US,"January 20, 2022"
"I've used Fox for both LAX & John Wayne Airports. The personnel have all been quite friendly and helpful. The vehicles are clean and I've been upgraded at no charge when my vehicle of choice was unavailable. If you catch their shuttle at the right moment, it's no issue. If you just miss it, it normally takes 20-25 minutes before the next shuttle shows up since they don't run as many shuttles as the other rental car agencies. However, the value and convenience of their app offsets that minor inconvenience.",5,US,"January 15, 2022"
"The entire rental process was fine and the car was as well. The problem is with administrative fees for tolls. You either pay an additional $20 a day for their toll pass or a $15. service fee for any toll you can't pay. For instance... there are pay by plate tills all over and since there are no toll collectors, the will bill the owner of the car by the license plate. So... for a 50cent toll, Fox Bills you an additional $15.00... I was recently in Florida and amassed $6.90 in tolls via Toll by plate.. I currently have a Past Due bill from Fox for $96.90... I tried calling Fox but no help..THIS IS THE LAST TIME I EVER RENT FROM FOX...",1,US,"January 14, 2022"
"The only real complaint I have is with the quality of the vehicle I was given.  On October 26th, of 2021, I reserved an all-wheel drive SUV from Fox, SPECIFICALLY because I knew I'd be travelling to a location with snowy and/or icy road conditions.  But when I arrived, on Decemeber 29th, to pick up my reserved all-wheel drive SUV, I was told that if I wanted something other than a two-wheel drive vehicle, I would have to pay $503.13 per day -- $400 more than my reserve confirmation estimate.  That is, by anyone's definition, a bait-and-switch -- which I believe is illegal.  At no point was I forewarned, so that I might make other arrangements; no, your company waited until I was at an off-airport location, with severely limited options, other than to accept a downgraded vehicle from Fox.  To add insult to injury, I was charged the exact same amount for a less safe vehicle.  Lastly, when I actually drove the two-wheel drive rental, I discovered that the front wheel alignment was so bad the steering would track and veer at unexpected moments, making it even less safe to drive in winter road situations.  I understand you overbooked rentals and other factors contributed, but your company had ample opportunity to inform me of the situation before I boarded your shuttle and left the car rental hub of the airport.  I believe Fox Rent A Car did this with the intent of making it harder for me to make other plans -- a form of rental extortion.",1,US,"January 13, 2022"
"I made the mistake of booking a car rental for two separate occasions on the same date. If I had known the issues I was going to experience with my first rental, I absolutely would have never rented again. However, since I pre-paid for the second rental, I wasn't allowed a refund 🙃.I was overcharged AFTER returning both rentals and have yet to be reimbursed despite calling every week for the past 2 months and visiting the San Diego rental hub twice, where i was assured I'd see the money reimbursed to my account within 48 hours.Additionally, I was not given back my $150 deposit upon returning each car in proper condition. I've emailed Customer service and billing and have yet to receive a response from either.I do not recommend renting from this company",1,US,"January 11, 2022"
"Fox DENVER airport was all in all horrible experience. They were nice upfront however when we turned the car in it was horrible. We rented the car from Priceline for $617. We thought that was the flat rate as it was advertised however we got hit with OVER $300 of charges when turning in the car. When I brought it up to the first guy he was all defensive and an absolute jerk!. Went to get his manager and she was worse.  The Manager was beyond unprofessional and tried to defend that it’s not false advertisement.  We were told “it’s not false advertisement..maybe false understanding!”  Not exactly customer service.  No attempt was made to break down the extra charges…only told multiple times, “false understanding!”   Horrible customer service and management at DENVER AIRPORT! Do NOT fall for FOX Prices as they are not true. YOU will have close to $300 in extra charges if you rent the car for a week. IF I were you DO NOT RENT FROM FOX!! Horrible! please listen to my review. I personally read about the charges and bad reviews from fox however I still chose to go with them. HORRIBLE DECISION!! We read multiple horrible reviews prior to our trip and try to take reviews with a grain of salt but mark my words….we should have heeded the multiple warnings!!!  When you look at enterprise, budget, hertz and other big name REPUTABLE rental services it seemed like their prices were so much higher!!!  After you add the extra fees from fox there were no savings.  Same price when you they add the hidden fees and HORRIBLE customer service!!! HORRIBLE!!!  They added my spouse as a driver and never told us there was additional fees for this!!!  My spouse never drove the car ONCE!!  But there was an additional 72.00 in fees for her!!  This place is a joke!!  Stay with a reputable car company.  Prices only look higher!  In the end they will be cheaper than this low rate car company!",2,US,"January 09, 2022"

"AVOID!!!! (Booked in my partners name Phillip) before it's said I had no booking...Our flight was delayed to the next day due to covid requirements changing at the last minute. We informed both Fox rental cars in San Francisco and Wise cars who we booked our rental car through. Wise cars said it's fine they've added an additional 24hrs to our booking. Fox said it's fine, inform Wise Cars.Arrived to Fox rental in San Francisco after 1.5hrs extra sat on the runway due to the plane needing de-icing before arrival at Heathrow. Plus the hour wait from passport control San Francisco end. We finally made it (within the 24hrs). Fox told us Wise cars told them we had 12 hours not 24hrs, our booking has expired and we need to pay for a brand new rental car!What?! Every car rental company asks for a flight number. The reason being if its late they know and can accommodate as much as they can with the vehicle you booked. Not steal your money and make you pay again. We were never a 'no show'.Both companies had our flight numbers so knew we would be later for reasons well beyond our control. Why bother asking for it if you are going to just cancel our booking and keep our money?!!!!We argued we had 24hrs and this was shown to Fox in an email from Wise cars to us. We also called Wise cars infront of the Fox desk man, and they spoke. The Fox rental guy said 'oh its been 25hrs now anyway' so we can't have a car unless we pay again! What a liar!We were absolutely shocked. After a long flight, delays beyond our control, we'd done everything we could have done, both knew our flight numbers so if they took the time they would see our flight delay, stood there with a baby and young child, we were left no option but to pay again. So the initial rental car was £814. Fox said they would match our previous booking. We then paid another £814 and they said we don't have insurance... We said under our previous booking we paid for all extras, including insurance and showed our email confirmation receipt.He had the cheek to say its not on his system, we never had it!!!! So of course we has to pay an additional £447. Totally disgusted.At the end of the day we had done nothing wrong. The two companies misinformation and lack of checking the flight arrivals has cost us a lot of money. Never use Fox rental cars or Wise cars in the UK. I'll be complaining to the max to recover this money. Totally disgusting in this day and age to still be dealing with people and companies such as this. Trading standards will be informed along with all other review platforms",1,US,"January 04, 2022"
"Was told at DIA Europar was really Fox and to use Fox shuttle. Waited about 30 minutes for shuttle.  When I finally got counter I was told I was getting some small SUV and not the pictured Jeep.  Car was switched at check out and rep said  ""ad states  Jeep or SIMILAR  car"". Sure enough, the fine print did say that, read every word of the ad.  I was totally annoyed but I needed car so I did upgrade. Got a Santa Fe which had a plastic cover missing on lower dash which was covering some wires---that did not give impression of car in good condition.  Asked for and received different car which had filthy interior, the back was covered with what looked like white pet hair.  Took the  car anyway just to get going.  When to car wash for vacuum, helped but did not get rid of hair. IN MY OPINION the moral of this story is you get what you pay for, in this case switched cars with less than adequate cleaning. It is Covid season so know in advance your car probably hasn't been cleaned as it would have been at other agencies.",1,GB,"January 01, 2022"

"Same experience as others. Fox has twice now done the same thing with reservations: what we reserved was not available and we had to pay a significant ""upsell"" price to get a vehicle that would fit luggage, 3 adults and 2 infants in car seats. This happened at Fort Myers in 2018 and again at Phoenix in 2021. This is their policy and practice it seems. Their agents must receive incentives to ""upsell"" and force insurance purchases which they mislabel as ""Loss Damage Waiver"" and ""Road Side Assistance."" You are also charged for both even if you have personal auto insurance with contractual liability coverage and belong to AAA! Have also never received any deposit returned even though my driving record is accident- free and vehicles have been used solely for transport to hotel location or relative's home 8 miles from the airport. Disgraceful that states permit this type of business to exist.",1,US,"December 29, 2021"
"I would give 0 stars if I could. We reserved a ""Compact SUV"" via Expedia for $451.22 total for a week; when I made the reservation it said clearly that this was a 4 door SUV for 5 passengers, 3 pieces of luggage, and 3 carryons. I even took a screenshot of the reservation but then (stupid me) forgot to print it out and did not bring the device with the screenshot on the trip. Boy do I regret that. When we got to the Fox counter, the agent insisted that we had reserved a 2-door Jeep that had no space at all for luggage - way too small for the 5 adults in our group - and when I tried to pull up the Expedia reservation to prove what I had reserved, it only had the info ""Jeep Compass or similar"" and ""5 passengers"". Agent named Angel continued to gaslight me and insist that we had reserved ""their smallest most compact vehicle"" and because I was not able to get Expedia on the phone while standing at the desk, we ended up getting charged an additional ~$500 for an ""upgrade"" to (basically) the vehicle I had originally reserved. Our $451 rental ended up being over $1000. I called Expedia when we got back from the trip, and the CS rep was very sympathetic and promised to work on resolving this and getting a refund, but I don't have a lot of hope given other reviews I've read on this site. Still waiting to hear back from Expedia. Bottom line: bring PROOF of what you reserved (take a screen shot of all the details and print it out, because your Expedia or Priceline itinerary may not have the details when you go to view it later)  - but also DON'T RENT FROM FOX THEY ARE THIEVES AND SCAMMERS.",1,US,"December 28, 2021"
"Folks, please do your research before EVER renting a car from this company. My partner and I arrived on a vacation in CA in early December 2021 and took a taxi to our hotel. We knew what activities we planned to see and thought it might be cheaper to rent a car. We checked online and although we are familiar with Enterprise, as we had used them plenty of times in the past, we decided to go with Fox rental because of their rate. We paid online, but once we arrived to pick up the car, the trouble started and I should have listened to my ""spidey sense."" Problem 1: We had to pay for supplemental liability insurance, after already purchasing insurance once we reserved the car.Problem 2: We had to pay a $150 deposit on the car with a credit card, when we didn't see that listed when we reserved the vehicle. Problem 3: They tried to upsell a few things, one thing that stood out had to do with the gasoline. They said it is $4.70ish to fill up in CA now, but that they could give us a $4.90 rate, so we didn't pay as much. We quickly turned that down as we our Costco members and knew we would fill up there for a discount. The car was some 4 door basic vehicle, that took a while to heat up but ran and that was all that we needed. The night before we left we stopped by a Costco 5 minutes from our hotel to fill up, we overfilled a bit and it only cost $15. The next day we drive to the airport ( 10 minutes away from the hotel) to return the car 2 hours early. A tech ( his name is Luis, and yep we are putting people on blast for this post) checked us in, took the car and we went downstairs because I wanted to ask a rep about our deposit return. Easy, peasy, right?We were told that the deposit should be credited back right away, that's all and I felt a bit uneasy with that answer, as if there was something that she left unsaid. As we go through TSA, my boyfriend gets an email from Fox rental, basically it shows that they were keeping $141 of my $150 deposit. As it was too late to go back, I figured I would deal with it when we returned home. At home, I reached out to their customer service line ( be prepared to hold and hold some more), I spoke to an agent, gave her the pertinent information and asked why they decided to keep my deposit and we were told because we returned the car empty and were charged almost $100 for fuel lol. A few problems with that; the car couldn't hold $100 in fuel, so what the heck and gas is $4.70ish in CA so how did they come up with that number. I knew my deposit was going to be returned so I was very calm with the agent and told her that we filled up at Costco the night before and have the receipt for that and that we also ( surprise) took a picture of the gas tank/ mileage on the morning that we drove to the airport. All time stamped and all would show that there was no way that the car was returned empty. She asked me to email that information over, which I did and 2 days later I was reimbursed 126.64 ( the insurance total of 23.26 wouldn't be returned, understandably).I want to thank the rep Andrea, for resolving this quickly. I want to again say Luis is a terrible person and a liar. How many other people have they pulled this scam on? People who didn't take a picture or have a gas receipt were definitely screwed over. Also Valerie the customer service rep tried ""hard to be helpful"" during pick up but she should have given us more information and told us more about their insurance options that they forced upon us. Valuable lesson learned, stay away from real foxes as well as Fox rental. Folks if you must rent from them, again.... ALWAYS take a picture of the gas mileage and the outside of the vehicle ( heck, they may say you got into an accident and force you to purchase their company a new car) and keep your receipts- anything relating to the gas, tolls, etc without those pics they probably won't care about your picture.",1,US,"December 26, 2021"
"I rented a car from Fox in Orlando FL, through Expedia.  It was for a compact SUV.  When I got to the rental counter, they said they didn't have that available and put me in a smaller car AND told me it would be $150 MORE than the $340 rate I was quoted through Expedia.  I went to a different agency and could overhear the next person in line that had the same situation.  If they don't have a specific car, that is understandable, but to charge almost 50% MORE for a smaller vehicle is just unacceptable.",1,GB,"December 22, 2021"
If I could give it a zero I would. I booked eurpacar that sourced to this company in lax. I had a confirmed check in and the counter guy lied that at as we were 3 hours late they cancelled our reservation. My booking paperwork said otherwise and they counter guy said pay in full and won't have issue. Offered is. Car double price in an area of lax that you have no other choice but to take car at this point. Absolute bait and switch completely lied with no paperwork to back up claims.

This place is horrible! What I thought was a good deal was nothing but a trick. They falsified the time I returned their car. And the time change was when I was on a plane.

"Everything was great and as agreed.I was worried after booking as I read some of these awful reviews, but my experience was great and the pricing as quoted.I mailed with questions ahead and received prompt responses.Upon pick up in Vegas, Zena was lovely, friendly and knowledgeable. She offered me their car insurance but wasn’t pushy when I declined as I’d bought a separate policy. She even helped me call my hotel as I’d arrived late.There are some comments in other reviews about it taking a long time to get from Vegas airport as you have to get two shuttles, which is a bind, but the Fox shuttle was waiting at the rental centre and was efficient.The car had some small scratches and dents, which was fine by me (as long as I wasn’t blamed for them, which so far I haven’t been).Drop off was quick, friendly and easy.If this is a typical experience I’d book with Fox again.",4,US,"December 12, 2021"

At the counter, a rather sleazy manager-type insisted that we had to buy their insurance, notwithstanding that I had in-state US insurance, on top of a credit card that covered me. Obviously, their insurance was overpriced, equal to the rental price. A pure rip-off, probably illegal for being undisclosed. (This is on top of long lines, rude service, etc.) Seems to be cheaper than the others, which is how they get you, and then turns out to be about 50% more.

"It was almost great! But I'll say that overall was very good. Just felt disappointed with some things - The car was smelling pretty bad, like cigar/cigarettes, I don't feel like the car had been clean before we use it. Also, we found a MOUSE in the car - the first day ate a piece of our chocolate one day, we couldn't figure out what it was so in the second day, me and my husband had just parked the car and I saw the mouse running up in my arm - we got off the car and spend like 20 minutes trying to get it off the car - it was a small mouse and it was afraid to jump from the car, I suspect that it was probably born there, I really don't think it could have jumped in. It worries me because, if it had crawled in our legs while we were driving we could have crash or something. We know it was already in the car when we got it because we hadn't open the windows of the car in the first days and we used few times. When delivering the car back, we told the guy that there was a mouse there and that the car had strong cigars smell, he said he would talk to the manager to see if he could give us a discount but today I see that they charged the regular amount with no discounts. But, Nelson was awesome in the first day welcoming us, all the staff was nice and the car, was a very good car, just not clean. We were in Miami beach, FL.",3,IE,"December 06, 2021"
"Fox Car Rentals is the worst company I ever dealt with in my life. We rented the car through Expedia whom they charged us €80 in advance which until now I don't know for what.

They charged us double the money we agreed on plus $150 succession fee which we were never never informed about. We feel disgusted and disappointed.

We were supposed to have been given an all wheel drive vehicle to drive on the freeway and come to find out we were given a front wheel drive. We sat stranded on a freeway for 4+ hours with absolutely no help from them whatsoever. Got stuck with a $1200 tow truck bill which I opened a dispute with them for reimbursement which then after 12 days of my request was told that it is solely my responsibility and has nothing to do with them.

"Having just returned from Los Angeles i can completely empathize with everything that has been written about this car rental company.I bought my C.D.W in the  U.K and informed the agent at the desk that i declined all insurances.Quite obviously my request fell on deaf ears as a couple of days later i looked at the agreement and saw that i had been charged for C.W.D  and S.L.i. inclusively.Finding it impossible to contact them by phone,i had to drive back to L.A.X and inform another agent what i had been charged.He asked to see proof of my U.k policy which i showed him.He then told me that he would remove the insurance that i already had bought in the U.K.but it was the law in California that i needed to have the Supplemental liability insurance so i agreed to leave that insurance on.On my last day in the U.s.a i looked at the agreement again and saw that he'd left the C.D.W on and taken the S.L.I off!!!  So basically, the insurance that he said i needed by law was removed and the insurance i already had he left on.On a more positive note after contacting Fox Car Rental by Facebook (the best way) i was lucky enough to be helped by someone who sorted the whole mess out for me in a very professional manner, the complete opposite of the 2 guys at the rental desk who,s main job it would seem is to add on as many insurances as they can either with your approval or not.So,if you want a smooth trouble free experience on your next car rental in the U.s.a then my advice is to stay well clear  in my opinion of this greedy, dishonest,car rental company.You'll save yourself a lot of stress by going with someone else.",1,CA,"November 30, 2021"

"I'm from Australia and booked a car online on Oct. 16, 2021 to pick up at MCO on Nov. 16, 2021 and price quoted was $US1,064.07 for the 21 days.When I arrived just before midnight closing time and checked in at their MCO office, I was suddenly charged $US1877.14 being OVER $US800 extra. Apparently Loss Damage Waiver @ $US 23.99 per day is a requirement, yet in their Terms and Conditions it IS NOT. I was lied to about this. I was also charged $US6.49 per day for Roadside Assistance, which I was NOT told about.FOX Rent-a-Car have breached their own Terms and Conditions. Once I can get back to Orlando later this week, this vehicle will be returned and I will expect to be refunded EVERY DOLLAR for each day I have not used this vehicle.VERY POOR experience - I usually book with another company and that's where I will be going back to next time.

"I booked through Priceline. Fox charged me an additional $295.06, after I paid for what I was quoted. I anticipated additional charges for toll roads, but not that I would be paying an additional $43 per day. My best advice is to go with reputable service provider, like Hertz or Budget. Don't make the mistake I did, and go with off-brand service providers, like Fox.",1,GB,"November 16, 2021"

"I rented a car from the company from November 7-13, 2021. I booked the rental through Expedia.com. When I booked the rental, the total cost is only $539.06.  After all the unnecessary charges the staff at the counter that I was forced to accept because of the made-up threats he made which I will expound later, the total cost shot up to $858.67.  Included in my booking with Expedia is collision damage plan worth $70 for the whole duration of the rental. When I came to pick up the car, the staff told me that the insurance I paid with Expedia does not cover the statutory limits provided by law. He made me pay for Supplemental Liability Insurance worth another $70.08 and Rental Liability Insurance worth another $83.94. When I searched online about this insurance coverage, the Expedia collision damage plan is already the same as the Supplemental Liability Insurance. This is clearly a deceitful, predatory and unfair practice of this business. In addition, he also forced me to purchase the Plate Pass worth $11.99 per day which he told me is for the toll fees. According to him, if I don't purchase the Plate Pass, and a bill for toll charges is sent to the company after the rental period, Fox would charge me $90 for each incidence of toll fee.  And this is why I agreed.But since it would cost $71.94 for the entire rental period, I asked him: ""What if I don't use any roads with toll fees on some days, will I be refunded for those days that I don't use roads with toll fees?"" He told me: ""Yes, you will be refunded"". During the 6 day rental period, we only used a road with toll fees once, when we went to Desert Hills Premium Outlets. So when I returned the car on the 5th day (shortened rental period), I asked the front desk staff whether I will be refunded for the days of the Plate Pass that I did not use any toll road (5 days total), the staff told me that there is no refund. So again, I was deceived by the staff who attended to me when I picked up the car about the refund for the Plate Pass. These unfair and predatory business practices of Fox Rent A Car should be stopped and they should be civilly liable for these deceitful practices. The name of the staff who attended to me when I picked up the car is Olufemi. The rental agreement only has his first name. Many tourists are not aware of the regulations of the country they are visiting. Businesses should not take advantage of this lack of knowledge to dupe them into accepting unnecessary fees.  I already reported this incident to the Better Business Bureau for resolution.  Aside from refund, I was also requesting from the Better Business Bureau that rental companies should already disclose all fees on the booking website.  I rented a car from Hertz on my first 3 days in Los Angeles (before going to Las Vegas and Aspen.  From Aspen, we came back to Los Angeles and rented from Fox.), Hertz did not charge any additional fees without proper disclosure.  They also did not offer any Plate Pass or any electronic payments for toll fees.  So the final cost of the rental almost did not differ with the cost stated on my Expedia booking.  What I learned from this experience is that by trying to save money by going to the so-called ""lower cost"" or ""budget-friendly"" establishments, you will end up paying more than what you would pay the ""high-quality, excellent service"" companies because the cost on the booking website is just another predatory tool to lure customers to book with them but they will charge you all kinds of unnecessary fees!   Will be renting from Hertz from now on.  We go on our annual vacation here in the US and will never rent from Fox again!",1,US,"November 12, 2021"

"In September 2021 I rented a car from Fox Rental Car in Salt Lake City, UT.  I reserved the car through my Expedia account which means the reservation was in my name.  We checking out the car, SEBASTIAN asked if there would be another driver, I said no my husband would be the only driver although the reservation was made in my name.  He said no problem.  When I signed for my credit card there was an additional amount of $150. quiche I questioned and was told it was because we didn't take the insurance from them but would be refunded when we returned the car.  WELL, when I was never refunded the $150 I called and they said it was for an additional driver and that I was told that.  THEY ARE LIARS and I would never, ever rent a car from them again or I would check every SINGLE DOCUMENT before leaving their grounds.....then again they would probably find something to charge you extra for!

"Why you should pay a little bit more for another rental cars companies and avoid the FOX rent-a-car.Here is the story from our last Colorado visit.It started at the Denver International Airport.In the spot, there was a group of people waited the shuttle. We saw all diff shuttles but FOX. After about 20 mins of waiting sporadically, we started to call FOX. An about 10 mins later a shuttle arrived.The way to the facility took about 15+ mins (no front desk at Denver Internation Airport).When we came to the front desk, the representative suggested updating the car to 4x4. The upgrade price is supposed to raise about $200 extra. We declined that option.The representative mentioned that it is a ""bad"" choice not to take the 4x4 option. We weren't paying attention to that until we headed the road. We've got an SUV with more than 67K miles. We had our first destination in Vail, Co. Just for reference, In AZ, NV, and other places in the USA and overseas we mostly used 2WD cars with no issues in different weather and surface conditions. So we didn't expect something unusual in CO too.The 2nd issue we've got was when we were on highway 70 and couldn't speed up from 50 m/hr up. Even when the accelerator was pushed to the floor level. To the Vail we were on the right lane and semi-tracks were passed us (it was dangerous and scared, because of the weather condition on 10/12/2021 (rain and snow)).For the record, when the car drove downhill we were able to get to 75 m/hr as per speed limit with no issues. There was a huge issue getting to the speed limit on any uphill road even in Denver, CO.The 3rd issue we found was when the back-view camera showed the image upside down. It was in the same unpleasant weather condition and just personal driving experience helped us. The safety-first wasn't in the car at all.Then we've got a low-pressure sign on the dashboard. The valet fulfilled the tires. We were lucky to have that service in the resort so we used it more than once when we stayed there. Another safety issue with the car for renters.A few times the back-view camera stopped working at all and was flashing when the reverse gear was used.When we returned the car the guy on reception looked described issues and told us that probably that car shouldn't go out at all.The FOX rental car company uses outdated, not safe and not so clean cars with a lot of mileage. Don't rent from that company!",1,AE,"November 03, 2021"

"Before writing this review  I tried  to reach Fox customer service on phone and I even sent them several letters but all without any success. I wasn’t able to reach them on phone and they haven’t answered my letters ever. I rented a car from Fox Fort Myers’ office last Saturday (RA: RSW- 215949). I booked via Priceline and the estimated costs were 289,29 USD. At Fox office I had to sign a rental agreement  but they never showed it to me. Instead they told me that the agreement would be sent me by email. It was a long line after me, so unfortunately I accepted this as I trusted them and thought that the agreement would be in order with my booking. When at home I checked the agreement, I realized that the estimated costs were 445,72 USD instead of  289 USD. They added 7 days ATS - tolls (83,93 USD), pre-paid fuel (52,12 USD) and some other fees I don’t understand at all. I never asked for anything of this. I told them that I would stay at the same town, so I don’t need PlatePass at all. They never asked me about pre-paid fuel. I wrote them a letter immediately asking to remove 7 AST and pre-paid fuel from my rental agreement as I never had asked for them. So far I haven’t got any feedback. I have never had such a bad experience with any other car rental agency.",1,US,"October 25, 2021"

I was then handed the rental agreement that did not list or itemize any of my charges.  I then called the office and asked for an itemized list of charges and they would not give them to me.  I was told they could not refund anything until i returned the car.   when i returned the car i was told i would be emailed a copy of the charges.  I still have not recieved that.

"My fiancé and I went to California.  We rented a car from Fox at LAX.  We drove the car to Bakersfield, CA.  That night our catalytic converter was stolen off of our rental.  We called the company, and they were wonderful about bringing us a new rental (brought us a new rental from LAX and towed the broken car back), and we were assured that we would NOT have to pay for the tow.  We used my insurance to take care of the repair, and went on our merry way.  We had to pay a $350 “administrative fee” that our insurance didn’t cover, and were told the claim was closed.  Now we received a bill for $818.00 for the tow.  I called the company and was told there were no notes about FOX paying for the tow in the account, and the “quality assurance” tapes were no longer available; we are required to pay the money or be sent to collections.  Well, we want to fight this on the principle.  It is absolutely unacceptable to say something is covered, and then charge for the service.  The dishonesty of FOX is absurd, and I caution anyone to EVER use this company.  I am disgusted with how wrong this is.  Dishonest and shady business practice should NOT be rewarded with new business.  Now our account is in collections, and will ding our credit report, and we have to hire a lawyer if we want to fight this.  Yes, it would be easier to just pay the bill, but how is that right?

"Will never use again! Customer Service from Management was unacceptable. I rented a car from SFO which is inconveniently OFF SITE of the airport, realised after stepping off the shuttle van that I had left my prescription sunglasses on the passenger seat back at FOX. I rang immediately and got no reply to Lost and Found - if it had been on the SFO location I could've retrieved them but FOX is 3 miles away and I couldn't walk there to retrieve and make my flight. I emailed and someone finally replied asking what they looked like. I sent a precise photo and then no reply. I had to chase down only for a terse, unprofessional reply from the manager that the car had been returned without any sunglasses. I do not understand how any employee who got in the car to at least inspect it, let alone clean it, did not notice a pair of sunglasses on the seat. Do they not even look in their cars before they send them back out again to the next car rental? He never responded again to my query. These were prescription glasses, not designer and only useful for myself and cost a great deal as they were transition and brand new. I would've paid any postage to have them return rather than shell out another $500 for new glasses. Disgusted by management. I was willing to give them a chance even though I was not informed whatsoever that they were based off site and you had to search to find them. But learned a lesson about hiring a cheap car rental.",1,US,"September 22, 2021"
"Let me start by saying I have rented from fox many times and have never been disappointed . I rented this car and feel very lucky I’m alive to emailand complain.  I came here for work on Friday Sept 10. I didn’t want the charger , but it was the only car available .  I was driving back from Murrieta , decided to stop and get gas. I was on a side street about 830pm on Sept 14.  I heard a huge pop  . Within seconds tire pressure gauge appeared and tire was at 18 and quickly went to 12, 9,6 . I pulled over to a lot and it was 2. I called 3 times and waited til 11pm The first girl was ok. The second one, Chris RUDE. ARGUMENTATIVE is an understatement . He argued my wait time. He argued about where I was . How I could still drive on the donut 92 miles to airport til 1230 . They wouldn’t let me call USAA. He argued I needed to buy a tire.  Now remember no service even came. How I should get a hotel. He had not a clue about anything.  I’m in the dark at 11pm during covid with no traffic nothing open with them telling me how by busy they were calling this “3rd party”He was absolutely the most ignorant non understanding customer I’ve ever spoke to. I called again.  This lady she was not as bad but not helpful. At this point im angry. Luckily an oreily delivery driver stopped to help. The jack we had was bent .  I expected to see a tire with road debris . No. Instead I saw a BALD, CRACKED tire plugged multiple times not fit for the road. I thank God it didn’t happen at a high speed.  I truly appreciate the swapping of cars at 3am rather than further wasting my work time the next day as well . I can’t help but wonder the reason was only because the service records were seen at this point and they knew  I had bad dangerous tires it’s obvious the plug popped inside . This car should never have been on the road.  This is what I want. $839 refund today.  If I don’t see the refund I will pursue it legally for extreme negligence as well it was traumatizing to myself and my daughter. Ive already spoken to my local personal Injury lawyer who is also my client . Please Advise ASAP when refund will be  appearing.

"Well, I'm currently waiting on the customer service line, have been transferred twice and its going on an hour.They charged me for a full tank of gas at 126.00, when in fact we filled the tank up at 6 miles left to the car rental. I also had some 12.15 reoccurring charge???After Norman checked the car, I asked for the receipt he stated you will get an email and any refunds come 24 to 48 hours later...never said a word about the gas charge and I don't remember signing anything.  The refund comment sounded strange, so at the airport got the email with the extra charge of over 126.00 for the 7.99 a gallon. Really? so I returned a rental car with a completely empty tank??? Well I have the debit charge to prove the fill up I was to pay 307, ended up being charged 469.Still on hold....going to call the credit card company and dispute the charge....this is ridiculous.Update they will reimburse me the tank of gas once I showed the receipts, so they say, no word on the 12.15 yet.Got the refund, David from fox very helpful.Always use credit card for gas to b prove you filled up.",1,US,"September 21, 2021"

"This review is for Denver Airport Fox Car Rental.I did an online booking for Fox, I knew they had very poor reviews but against my better judgement booked anyway. This was a $332.39 mistake.I booked a intermediate SUV (Rogue, Rav4 or similar)after waiting in line 45 minutes it was my turn. I've rented many cars in my lifetime so I knew the routine.The guy doing the paperwork (Christopher) seemed pretty nice. He mentions they have plenty of cars and can upgrade me to a 4 Runner for same price as the small SUV. Me ""same price?"" Yes, same price you booked online. Here's where the incident happens. Yes, it was the same price as the small SUV but it was added to the price of the small SUV I booked.So a $415 one week rental turned into $748!Their paperwork is very confusing, where you sign, it says ""Minumum.7 days @32.48/day not to exceed $280. That's great I thought, that's the online price. So then you sign the paper copy and a couple electronic pads that you really don't know what your signing.Then he presents another paper that shows the charge breakdown. I look at the list and see $280 for the small SUV and down the list I see another $280 that says upgrade @$40x7days=$280 with taxes and fees adds up to $748.33. I enquired about the $748, he was very hard to understand with the loud ambient noise and mask on. (they use this to their advantage)I heard him say ""don't worry that will drop off when you bring the car back"" Okay, I had security deposits on car rentals promptly returned, no problem. So I signed the doc.Later that day I was looking at the receipt  thinking something's not right here so I called ""customer service"" After the usual press1 press3 press# I get annoying  music. Now, here I'm on a pleasure trip sitting in a coffee shop with my phone, the line open for 1hour 45 minutes. Guess What? Disconnected!Tried few hours later, nada..Next day..nada. Zero customer service!!This transaction went seemingly so smooth, I'm sure the counter reps are trained how to drain every penny out of tired, hurried travelers. Please read all the one star reviews! Make a smart decision, don't use Fox to save a buck it will cost you far more than you think.!  P.S. The 4runner was the worst vehicle I ever rented. Filthy inside and out, AND dangerous.

"Updated:  Fox responded to this post with “sounds as if you need roadside assistance “… yeah, no crap, but nobody answers.DO NOT RENT FROM THIS PLACE.  We picked up our car at the LAX location 4 days ago and it has been a nightmare since.  I have been trying to get a hold of someone now for 3 days to discuss all our issues and I can't get a response to online forms, emails, or voicemails.First it took me over 40 minutes to pick up my car because of all the upselling the counter agent tried on me.  After I declined everything, he tried to sneak in extra insurance.  He did sell me on upgrading to another vehicle, mostly because it had navigation.  We were traveling to some areas where cell reception was going to be spotty, so I thought this was worth the money.  Once I was in the vehicle, I quickly discovered it had no navigation.Then, the CarPlay, which was our only other source of navigation stopped working and I could not reconnect to it.Now, we have a big crack in our front windshield and I can't get anyone to discuss the matter with.  I tried several of the numbers they supplied me at pickup and they just hand up on you.This place is a ""discount"" car rental place for sure....you get what you pay for.",1,US,"August 05, 2021"
"Told us that giving a bigger car and gave us a smaller car. Charged for prepaid gas without asking. Unclear fees on a bill, most likely hidden.",3,US,"August 04, 2021"
"This company is utterly ridiculous. They gave me no option to pay tolls with an ez pass or by cash (which many tolls don't allow you to anyway). There was no question about tolls and they never asked or warned me! But then I got a bill from them which had a total of $18.60 in tolls and $60 in ""administrative fees""! 3x the actual tolls in fees is absurd!! It should be a percentage, not a flat fee and they should have to question you about this when you sign the rental agreement. I after I refused to pay, they sent me to collections, then when I wrote them a letter explaining and sending them a check for the total tolls and 15% for administrative fees, they still wouldn't budge and continued to send collections after me for the full $60 in administrative fees. I will absolutely never rent from Fox Rent A Car again and I warn you against doing the same. This is an unethical practice and needs to be examined by some government official. Highway Robbery!!! Don't do it, find another company!",1,US,"August 03, 2021"

"Illusion of on site car pick up in fort Myers is a lie! No big deal to wait on a shuttle, but hard to figure out where and when the shuttle comes! There was never a note displayed anywhere about $150 deposit if using credit card or $400 if using a debit card. To pay for car insurance was forced upon us(an additional $100). Completely disgusting cars. Car was dirty when we got it. When returned we were rushed to get out of it, rushed so much the shuttle driver had to get out and help us get our luggage. We were also told the car had to be returned at 1/2 tank. We returned it at 3/4 and was charged $201 that can not be explained nor was the email of those charges ever sent. ALSO, workers are rude in the inside building. Lady did not even acknowledge that I had already had paid $237 for the car. Complete scam. And I will be contacting Expedia about even listing them as a rental and I will be disputing the $201.",1,US,"July 17, 2021"

"Worst experience with any rental company ever, and I travel a lot. Two shuttles to get to Fox Rental Car and that I wouldn't have even minded had I not gotten robbed once I got there. I was charged for insurance I didn't ask for, and gas I already filled up. My mistake was upgrading the vehicle I had ordered on a third party site. They said it would be an additional $35 a day, for 4 days which I agreed to. I refilled the gas but they told me they already charged me for gas, which they said they returned, but did not. I have $360 of charges which just do not add up, even including the insurance I didn't ask for or want. I tried to get through to customer service, there are hours wait times and no one responds to your emails, probably because they rob everyone. I already filed a fraud dispute with my credit card company, am in contact with the BBB, and am looking into legal recourse. It might not be that much money, but based on the reviews it keeps happening repeatedly to customers. I will never use them or the third party site again. In addition, all the vehicles I had to choose from were scratched and dirty. We chose one that smelled the least, and it had a stale hotdog bun left by a previous renter under the seat we got to find mid trip. Disgusting, dishonest, and unsanitary.***In response, I did speak with them and they agreed to reverse charges they never did. You know who I am. Give me back my money.I'm not playing these dumb roundabout games.",1,US,"July 06, 2021"
"NEVER EVER DO BUSINESS WITH FOX RENT A CAR! Our airline had a glitch and cancelled hundreds of flights. We called Fox to tell them we would arrive late and to hold our car. They said we would have 3 hours grace. The first 1 1/2 hours was before we landed. This meant we had to arrive between 5 and 6:30 am when they first opened. We arrived at 5:30 am and were told the deal was no longer good, but they could rent us the same car at three times the price. We declined.",1,US,"June 30, 2021"

"On June 2 we flew into SAN airport and had scheduled a pickup at 4 pm.  As our flight was early, we assumed there would be no problems in getting our car at Fox before 4 pm.  We were 45 mins earlier than our scheduled pickup time of 4 p.m.  Valerie said NO.  She said there were no cars available.  However, she would, for an additional $258.76 give us what was available on the lot.  As we did not want to wait for 45 mins and wanted to avoid the San Diego traffic if possible, we felt as if we had no choice.  In order to get on the road, Valerie said the only option was to pay the additional cost or wait until 4 p.m.  We checked out at 3:31 p.m. - half an hour early.  We are disgusted.  When we have rented from any other car rental agencies, we never had to pay extra in order to get the car if we were 45 minutes early to our schedule pickup time.  I feel that we should never have been charged this additional fee and would certainly hope that our money will be refunded.  Based on whether we get a refund, will depend on whether we rent from Fox again.",1,US,"June 27, 2021"

"Like others I had a horrible experience with Fox. I feel cheated. I agreed to pre-paid fuel and after I returned my car, a few days later I get a ridiculous charge of $410 so I'm thinking, its just a mistake. I tried calling their customer service line and waited, and waited, listening to their automated messages about how much they pride themselves with customer care. No answer for over an hour. Yes, I actually waited an hour. Then I tried calling another 2 times and waited less but I realized that I am not going to get through. So I go on to their website and try the live chat. I finally got through. I told the service rep about the situation and his response, was I don't deal with this. Please call our customer service line. At this moment, I realized I'm getting the run around and nobody is here to help. I emailed them and never got any response. Based on all these 1 star reviews. My experience was not personal. Everybody seems to be experiencing the same thing. Do yourself a favor and pay that extra money to go somewhere else because in the long run you will end up paying more here.",1,CL,"June 23, 2021"
"Fox Rent a Car is the WORST! DO NOT RENT WITH THEM!!when we arrived to pick up the vehicle on Thursday, June 3, 2021, the seller who attended me refused to give me the car unless I took out Liability insurance that according to him it was ""mandatory"" in the state of Florida, which is a LIE, the man insisted and lying, refused to give me the car unless I agreed to take out the insurance, I had to accept it, paying an extra 156 dollars to the rent of the vehicle, in addition there was no discount for reducing the rent for one day and the man was VERY insistent that he did not have to deliver the vehicle with a full tank so that they could charge me the extra gasoline, noting it in the lease Attached, after leaving the rent a car I found out about the insurance and they told me that it is NOT mandatory, that the agent lied to me. When I returned the car they told me that I had already signed the insurance so nothing could be done, refusing to give me more information. Personally, I feel SCAMMED by FOX rent a car and I will never rent with them again or with the companies associated with them.We rented trough EUROPCAR, and when we contact them, Fox tells them that the extra 156 dollars are from an UPGRADE they offered us FOR FREE!! they are covering the charges!! DO NOT TRUST THEM!!",1,US,"June 22, 2021"
"We rented a 2020 Elantra SEL for six days for a total of $193.33 at the Fox Rent A Car, SFO Airport. (Note:  Thrifty was going to charge $630.25 for six day car rental.)  To get to Fox Rent A Car from SFO Airport, you need take the Blue Line Air Train from the terminal to the Rental Car Center. Upon arrival at the rental car center, follow the signs to shuttle island 2 outside the building (a bit of a walk) and wait for the Fox shuttle bus to go to their off airport rental counter.  Once we arrived at the rental counter, we waited a very long time because people ahead of us were having some problems.  Once we got the car keys, we documented all the scratch and dents on the car (took pictures of everything including their document).  Make sure you do not overlook this step.  ALERT:  Cars rented from Fox are equipped with a PlatePass device on the front windshield. They are going to try and sell you the optional PlatePass All-Inclusive service at $11.99+tax per rental day (max. 15 day charge), which covers all electronic tollways and bridges. They also tell you if you choose not to purchase the optional  PlatePass All-Include service at the commencement of your rental and you utilize a PlatePass Toll Road, then you will be charge a $15.00 admin fee per toll ($90.00 maximum per rental agreement) plus the price of the toll and fees from the tolling authority.  We optioned NOT to take the PlatePass All-Inclusive service and instead connected our Android phone to the car display/monitor and used the phone GPS system to avoid all toll roads.  FYI: The Golden Gate Bridge does not charge a toll if you are heading north out of San Francisco (it does charge a toll if you are heading into San Francisco).  Choosing to avoid toll roads only added about 40 minutes to our drive from Napa Valley back to the SFO airport area (routed us through San Jose).",3,US,"June 21, 2021"
I had rented from Fox rental car company. The toll fee $1.84 plus fee charged $15.00 then Fox company charged me $61.84. What kind calculation is that ?? What a rip off company. I would never rent a car from this company again.,1,US,"June 21, 2021"

"Upon my prepaid rental pickup for an suv (that I already paid $650 in February) the woman at the desk (Deonica) told me that an upgrade would be an extra “$250” for which I interpreted it as $250 total cost and come to find out she charged me $250/ day for 10 days and never specified any of this and never told me the total. She then proceeded to tell me to “Scroll through and sign” the screens on the tab lying about what they were stating so I wouldn’t notice the extra $4600 she charged me.  I also declined all additional coverage on the car and she continued to charge me for every additional coverage they offer at Fox and lie to me! She knew I had small children who were sick and waiting in the 95 degree heat (per Fox policy that the children had to wait outside,) and she took advantage of me.When I noticed how much she charged me I brought the car back the next day (as I was in the hospital with my child,) I stated how unbelievably dishonest as well as completely slimy that situation was and I was returning the car and wanted my money back. I agreed to pay for the 1 day that I had the car as I should have not trusted her and gone through everything more carefully sooner.  This women Deonica who said she is the manager said she would take the car back but she had to charge me for all the fees she illegally charged me and 2 days with the car which came to $1243! So this total is now $1243+$650=$1893 I had to pay for a 1 day rental. My family and I are beyond belief with the criminal activity and dishonesty that Fox rental has portrayed  and I will NEVER rent from Fox again. I have also already told over 50 people (friends, family and complete strangers,) about this terribly awful encounter I had. I will continue to write reviews reflecting this situation on ever platform I can find. I was robbed with out a gun from Fox and I want my money back!

I would go with a competition that was $200 more expensive to avoid FOX. They have the worst customer service I have ever experienced and are willfully trying to cheat you out of your money.Watch, below they will copy and paste a reply that starts with ""I am very sorry to hear ...""

"I generally don't leave reviews but I had a terrible experience with Fox Car Rentals so I feel like I have to. Their customer service was terrible. The person checking me out added all the extras to my bill without asking me and luckily I asked what the total was before I paid or I would not have known, and the response when I questioned what had happed was very snarky. I was then given a car that smelled like cigarettes and when I came back to let them know in I got an annoyed ""Well, does that bother you?"" and they reluctantly gave me another vehicle. Returning the car went smoothly, but I will not be using them again.",2,US,"June 12, 2021"

One of the worst customer service experiences I've had in several years.

I would give a no star rating if I could.",1,US,"June 11, 2021"
"Not impressed with Fox at all.  The counter service person was watching a movie on her phone and laughing hysterically and seemed bothered that I would have the nerve to interrupt her.  I had to fill out a form highlighting all the scratches on the car and when I finally got in, it smelled like weed!  Low class organization and very disappointed.  I have never had to fill out a scratch and dent form with any other company so I was very suspicious.  Could not wait to return the car and say goodbye to Fox.",2,US,"June 09, 2021"
"Wow. I am another one giving fox rental 1 star. Customer service when picking up vehicle is shady by rushing and not letting you know the exact charges. They are not transparent. Also just forget about calling Customer service. I called them 3 times and was put on hold for an hr each time, I had to hang up. This is pathetic Customer service. Bottom line this is my opinion only.. Whatever deals one receives, and the deal has Fox rentals with it, just decline it.",1,US,"June 07, 2021"

The car was fine a small economy that did the job. I got to the counter in Miami and the customer service representative was rude. He asked for my ID and said sign and check off the next 5 boxes. He the asked me if I could hurry up cause there was people waiting.  I took care of that and then he handed me the keys. Nobody walked around the car to check out for any damage.  When I  returned the the I had forgotten my ear buds I called the lost and found extension and left a message twice and nothing from them Then last night I get home and I get a bill from Fox for $10 worth of tolls (which is fine I used the tolls). However they attached a $90 administrative charge!!! What the hell is that!!! Totally unacceptable!!! I will not be using Fox nor will I recommend it!!! And they will be hearing from me over that charge!!!,1,US,"June 02, 2021"
"I rented a car from FOX in Seattle, Wa.  I had rented from them before, not by choice, I usually use a third party like Priceline.  They don't have the best counter Customer Service, but usually have good rates.  I had rented a Dodge Caravan and it worked well for my family of adults.  At the beginning of the trip, not long after getting the rental car, it was noticed that the middle seats almost had an ejection latch, they violently flung up to let the people in the back out.  At a stop I was lifting the latch to let out the back passengers having control of the seat, my hand was up by the headrest.  The headrest violently flung down on my pinkie finger, catching it and at that point I let go of the seat from pain.  The seat had broke my finger!!!  When returning the car, I told the young man what happened and it seemed like that was not the first time he'd heard something like that.  I did go on line and responded to 2 separate surveys, 1 from FOX and the other from Priceline indicating what had happened.  That was almost a month ago and still no response from either survey!!! I had indicated in both surveys that I always respond to the surveys and have never gotten a response.  I had hoped this would be a serious enough issue to deem a response.",2,US,"June 01, 2021"
"Researching details of a rental for an upcoming trip, and Fox Rent a Car popped into my suggestions; this triggered the horrible experience I've had with that company.In 2017 I booked a flight & the car rental with Fox via SouthWests website, from NYC to FL (for my baby sisters graduation from FIU). Fast forward to December, flight went spectacular, had my reservation in hand with full flight info. I arrive at the Fort Lauderdale airport location only to be told, by an extremely rude staff, because I have a FL drivers license they are NOT allowed to rent to me. I tried calling corporate, no answer. I asked to speak to a manager but ""nobody was there who could speak to me"". Mind you, this was a prepaid; I'm standing there respectfully trying to speak to the woman, who tells me despite having a roundtrip ticket and being pre-booked; I can NOT rent from them. Then she demanded I leave their office to which I harshly retorted ""NO, it's hot outside and the shuttle isn't here"". She threatened to call the cops, I said go ahead; and we can have a strong record of what just went down when I get in contact with corporate...she backed down.I then had to carry everything back outside to the shuttle, and wander around the terminal from rental place to rental place...after almost an hour roaming around and browsing the web; I finally found 1 that had a few cars even with all the graduations going on.I contacted corporate a few times, and still received no response. Finally I gave up; but anytime I think about it, I'll give them the review they deserve! They almost ruined my family celebration of my baby sisters graduation.

"This was not the best rental car experience ever. Vehicle pickup definitely needs a little finessing. The time to process this was crazy. Almost an hour after getting shuttled over to the Rental facility is NOT good. The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the return process was AMAZING!Next bad thing was the toll road. Luckily we only went through one. I read another review where they had the cars set up to automatically bill their cars. Which means even if you pay the tolls, you will still get billed by fox. I didn't get the option to pay the tolls in California as they had no one working the toll booths due to covid. I got a bill for a $6 toll and a $15 admin fee. So they charged me $15 to mail me a bill. This is UNACCEPTABLE! I will not be taken advantage of due to a pandemic out of my control! I won't use your services again just due to the toll charges.

I paid for the weekly business rental in advance; arrived at the Hollywood Burbank Airport; walked the long distance out to the rental car area, after a long flight, only to discover that somehow, the reservation was made for the Fox location at LAX.  Since I wasn't and didn't fly into LAX, what good would that do me?  I assumed that they would simply correct the error, by switching the car to the correct location; but instead, they said ""no refunds, no reservation modifications"" ""you'll have to rent another car.  I couldn't believe this. I called Priceline, and they called the Fox location, but they were unable to remedy the situation either.  So, renter beware!

"Avoid Fox at all costs!  We rented a car from the Denver airport.  An hour later the shuttle showed up.   Of course you can't get a hold of anyone, so we just stood there contemplating trying to Uber to the Fox location.  Once we get to check out counter, I could barely hear the lady ""helping"" us.  There was very loud drilling at the computer next to us.  I ended up just shaking my head be I had no idea what she was saying.  The car given to us was dirty and appeared to be just passed from the previous customer to us.  It definitely hadn't been vacuumed or washed.  I thought the lady said someone would check us out, but there was no one around and no check out signs.  So I'm not even sure what she was talking about. Other than being dirty the actual car was fine and we had no issues.   I was expecting to have an awful return process, but it was actually pretty painless.  The real issue some 2 months after we rented the car.  I've gotten 3 invoices, so far, totaling over $100 for tolls.  The tolls themselves are only about $20 but I've been charged $90 in administrative fees.  Now I can't seem to get a hold a customer service representative to get clarification on the charges, and who knows how many more invoices they will be sending.

Well once we realized he was not being truthful we tried calling to let him know that wasnt what we had witnessed, we were put on indefinite HOLD for hours to never 1x speak with anyone. They also added insurance when I was using my own. At drop off I told the lady we were not happy being lead wrong, and the lack of integrity was mind blowing. She said she would remove it and I would have to call the tolls and pay if I didnt pay and they were billed I would owe $15per toll.

The gentleman working couldn’t break down the price to tell us the exact numbers. We were not given the vehicle we originally reserved. Once we got in the car, the vehicle had a strong smoke/weed smell. At the time, it was something I thought I could deal with (as I’m not one to complain). What set me over the edge and what prompted me to write the review was that on the last day we had the vehicle, my husband found a bag of weed in the car while cleaning out our trash. The vehicle was rented out of Florida where it is currently illegal. When addressing the issue when dropping off the car we were told “it’s only a $250 fine”. There was no effort to try to make right over the fact that we have been driving around with an illegal drug in the vehicle for five days.",1,US,"May 11, 2021"
"Unfriendly customer service, over charge fees, I really don’t recommend this place to anyone",2,US,"May 10, 2021"
Terrible.  Don't rent from these folks.  I gurantee that whatever you are quoted your final invoice will be doubled.  I went in with a quoted price of 316 with a 72 dollar fee to pay when i picked up (and a 200 dollar deposit).  These folks tack on so many hidden charges and rattle away all sorts of nonsense at pickup that I ended up with a 676 dollar invoice.  The man at the desk claimed it was cheaper to do pre-paid gas but failed to mention that even if i brought the car back at 3/4s full that they would charge the full amount.  He added in a second insurance that I did not need.  Go with one of the other well known car rentals and not this company.  They are scammers.,1,US,"May 04, 2021"
To start with we had over a 2 hour wait in line to get the car. Very disappointed in the time it took people to go though their process then had to go out the garage and wait again. A rock hit the windshield on the way back to the terminal. We notified the attendee and filled out the paperwork required with our insurance information. Received a calles from Fox 5 days after returning home that we needed to pay the amount and file through the insurance ourselves which is no problem.  When I received the email with the charge from the glass company it was different than what I was charged.  When I calles to ask about it the customer service rep was very rude. For someone who is dealing with people she needs a more people skills.  When she asked for the claim number and I didn't have it she told me to call back when I had it. I told her no to just hang on a second. She told me she had other people calling and again I could call back. She also informed I should have had an itemized receipt with all the charges. She was adamant that I should have has it in the email I received. When she looked at the email she had not sent it. There was an addition $75 dollar charge for process the claim. I have never had such an experience with a car rental company and will never rent through them again.,1,US,"May 03, 2021"
"If they have a review higher than a one star they paid some one to put it there as nobody in their right mind would pay to rent a car and when they get there to pick it up have to wait 3 hrs ? Employees don’t care and management is rude ,, don’t rent here",1,US,"May 03, 2021"
Just rented from fox.Made the reservation on line through Europe at which I was not aware that it bought Fox and subsequently would be picking up the vehicle fro fox.I have had bad experiences with the Salt Lake City locations in the with charges and dirty smelly cars.For that reason I do not rent from fox.This particular time I was not aware that europcar at the time of prepared reservation made that it would be fox.Since I had prepaid with the conditions of no refunds or date changes allowed or for not using the reservation I had to go through with the reservation.Not only is their shuttle filthy their cars are also filthy foul smelling and they overcharge you additions to the already agreed price online reservation. If you complain of the the vehicles condition and request for clean car they make you feel like you should except the car and asking for too much.So overall their customer and vehicles are very poor.Now it may be that I am the few that seems to have luck bad luck that is but I will never knowingly rent from FOX at least not Salt Lake City.They make so difficult to talk to someone about your concerns or disputes they never answer the phone or give u an option for call back.,1,US,"April 29, 2021"
Zero stars. Waited an hour!! 2 girls. 20 or more people waiting in line.. after all that get in car its old dirty stained seats.. junk. So I asked for different car.

"I was given a car that looked really dodgy, there were scratches all over it and there was some sort of tape holding a part together. The next day the car was given a ticket for expired plate. I called customer service and was on hold for 50 minutes and the rep insisted that the tags had been renewed. He was neither apologetic or empathetic at all. He told us to bring the car back to the airport. So I drove an hour to get to the airport. A shout out to Terrah who was super efficient and gave us a new car in no time. She promised us 1 day complimentary rental plus gas rebate which she clearly wrote on the contract. The minute I sat in the car I noticed the tire pressure was low so had to wait some more to get air in the car. Today I see the charges and they never gave me credit. I tried calling and have been on hold for the last 45 minutes. Horrible experience overall. I have sent an email about this issue to their billing department, let us see how long that takes. Next time I will opt for a reputed company even if it costs a bit more.",1,US,"April 22, 2021"

"We are senior citizens that travel a lot and have rented cars many times. I have rented from Fox several times in the past and always been satisfied. I rented from the (off airport) facility in Orlando from April 9-19, 2021 and was very unhappy. It was actually the worst car rental experience I have ever had.First, we agreed to rent a full size car which Fox describes as for 5 adults and 4 bags, Toyota Camry or similar. Upon check in, we were assigned (not pick any car from a certain row as in the past) a Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross, which has the distinction as the worst automobile I have ever drove. I am 6'3"" and when the seat was all the way back, it was comfortable for my 5'4"" wife, but not at all comfortable for me. There is no leg room (side to side) in the front.When we tried to put our suitcases in, we had to fold the rear seat down to get 2 (airline legal) standard suitcases in the rear. This is not a full sized car, useable for 5 adults and  4 bags, or certainly not a car that should be compared with a Toyota Camry in size, or any other way!When we opened up the door, the first thing my wife said was this car hasn't been cleaned. After examining it, I would say partially cleaned. It appears that it had been vacuumed, but nothing else. We actually had to stop and clean the inside of the windshield, because the sun was glaring off the dirty glass so bad that we couldn't see. Maybe that would have been acceptable in the past, but during COVID, it is totally unacceptable. As I said, I have rented from Fox several times in the past. I probably won't consider Fox in the future.",1,US,"April 20, 2021"
"Although there was no line at the pickup, the clerk was trying to up sale me every step of the way.  I told him I already pre paid for the car online, $312 for 6 days, I did decide to have insurance for the car and to have not have to worry about the gas.  The clerk stated that the gas was cheaper at Fox.  He failed to tell me that no matter how much gas you need, they will still charge you for the entire tank.  So I didn't even use a 1/2 tank of gas, but had to pay for an entire tank.  Sneeky!He said that the $150 would be returned once the car the trip was complete, haven't seen it.On returning the car, 1 day earlier then expected, I was charged an additional $239.30( Gas and Insurance)  Wow!  So my $312.47 rental car cost $551.30! Get the Turo app, I don't know why I didn't!!  No hidden fees!",1,US,"April 16, 2021"

"Without a doubt the worst company I've ever done business with ... If you are in the Seattle area and plan on driving to mt Rainer...don't do Fox!!!   This company will literally try to kill you ... And there help desk / oxymoron was actually more frustrating than having to buy a tire just to get to safety... After showing pictures of my tire with wires sticking out of it they said they couldn't see it...took it to les schwab tire center where a very nice employee spent about 30 minutes on the phone with there helpdesk/oxymoron explaining that we could die driving up a mountain on that tire... To make a long story never ending ,I bought a tire ... I saved the old tire and brought it back to the airport for review, much to my surprise (sarcasm) they literally acted like they had no idea what a tire even was..... Bottom line is ... If you are using Fox rental , you've probably been making bad decisions for awhile.... But still ,you should be safe and get what you pay for.",1,US,"April 11, 2021"

"NOT using FOX again. When we arrived at the PHX airport to pick up the vehicle we were checked out by Robert. He was friendly at first. He told us that we would be getting a Dodge Journey. We reserved Hyundai Sante Fe. We asked if there was another vehicle besides the one assigned to us. (I understand similar vehicles. We needed one with the room I have a big teenager and husband) He then proceeds to tell us why the Journey was better than the Sante Fe. We didn't care about why. He then wanted to sell the extra driver, insurance, etc. We told him our insurance covered the rental and no we would not pay the extra for another driver. He still persisted. He basically told us because we the cheap price for the rental we will be getting the Journey. He seemed upset that we booked with a third party and got the price we did. I signed the papers to just get away from him. As I was walking away, I heard him say out loud and snarky about difficult customers. I didn't think we were difficult at all. My husband was tired (it had been a long day our flight has been delayed three hours) and didn't want the Journey. However, my husband's attitude was reflected by the Fox associate's attitude. I don't believe the customer is always right but, the associate can keep his opinions to himself. He can learn to be nicer, politer, and just do his job. He should never speak about customers in front of other customers. He was just rude. Maybe he should learn how to keep his mouth shut and learn better customer service. Oh and the car was dirty and one of the tires was out of balance.",1,US,"April 09, 2021"
I missed my flight due to a airport location that doesn’t a have a location to return my car early in the morning first flights leave Ontario ca at 6am the rental office doesn’t open until 6 am and they are not at the terminal they are offsite but claim to be a airport location.

They tried to tell me my car insurance in Missouri was no good in Florida and wanted me to get theirs. I refused. She told me that I had to have a sunpass or I could not use the highways.

I have been trying to protest the charge for two weeks now and I have either waited on hold with customer service for over 2hours at a time or when I finally did get through, was immediately hung up on.

This is the worst of the worst rental car companies.

"This was BY FAR the worst car rental experience of my life. Nothing even comes close. And it is all attributable to the company. I spent THREE HOURS at the Fox office near Denver airport. 2.5 hours in a huge, snaking line before I even got to the counter, then after completing the paperwork another half hour for the car. This during Covid, in a crowded line with virtually no social distancing possible and plenty of anti-maskers. The employees could give no adequate explanation for the wait. Yes it was a busy Saturday afternoon in spring skiing season. But there were 6 computer terminals at the desk and only 3 of them were manned. The amount of volume couldn’t have been unexpected; there is no excuse. When we finally got the car it was a Mitsubishi Outlander, which was absolutely horrible. I had been promised a Jeep Compass or equivalent. The Outlander was significantly smaller than the Compass (I saw them side to side in a parking lot later in the trip).  The Outlander's front wheel drive had horrible traction that gave me trouble on snow several times.  Also, the car was filthy — I have photographs to prove it — with a huge, gross, spilled-coffee stain right next to the steering wheel (should have been impossible to miss for anyone cleaning the car). I typically try for the best price for a car rental, all other things being equal. This horrific experience made it clear that all other things are NOT equal. In the future I will be willing to pay more to avoid FOX at any cost.",1,US,"March 30, 2021"

"This was the absolute worst rental car experience I have ever had. When I walked up to the counter, one of the employees was yelling at a customer ahead of me in line and told the customer to ""shut the 'F word' up"".I had prepaid for a compact SUV (Kia Sorento or Hyundai Santa Fe) for a total of $521.88. When I landed in Denver there was a snow storm and I was told there were traction laws and I would need an AWD or 4x4 vehicle. To upgrade, I had to pay an extra $871.58! My total rental cost for 5 days for a Ford Expedition was $1,393.46. Compare that cost to ANYWHERE else and you can see I was completely gouged by Fox Rentacar.Then, I waited 45 minutes for them to get the car to me and it was filthy and smelled like marijuana. There was dirt all over the inside of the car and dirty windows on the inside as well.Right before I returned the vehicle, I filled it up with gas and they still charged me $77.83 for gas!You can't make this stuff up!Go with the Budget, Avis, National, and any other well-known brands and don't make the mistake I made by choosing the company that looked most affordable online.Also, I should have read the reviews before going with this company.

"Too bad there is not an option to choose zero stars. Waited 30 minutes for shuttle at SLC. Driver was rude and was kicking people’s suitcases to move them. Shuttle was ancient and filthy. Once at the rental office, was first in line but still took close to 20 minutes to complete the transaction, despite having a reservation.  Office also filthy. Finally got the keys and went to the lot to inspect the car. Giant dent in the front left panel. Car smelled of old cigarette smoke and numerous air fresheners. Seats were dirty and stained. Rented an SUV and the one they gave me did not have 4WD. These cars are very beaten up and not maintained or cleaned.

"Reserved a car at PHX airport.  AA changed their flight schedule, and we were going to be arriving 5 hours later than when we booked. - First called Airport Rental Cars (the party we booked with).  They said they could not alter the reservation and to call FOX.  Well, after over 20 minutes on hold, I was told THE SAME THING by Fox, that they could not modify the reservation.  I was not asking to change the date, vehicle type, or location.  All I wanted was a way to let the agents in PHX know that I was arriving late.  I can't believe there was not an internal phone number or email that the agent had access to, to accomplish this. She said I should take the shuttle bus to the rental location, wait in line, and then find out if my car was still available (they only hold the res for 3 hrs). This is the opposite of customer service.I asked to speak to a supervisor, and was told nobody was available.  I left my number and was promised a call back, but guess what? NOBODY called me.I don't understand why they would not want me to complete this rental.  I made other arrangements and they lost a customer.I did email the company, and the response I received was barely readable, as the person writing it did not have a good command of the English language.Would not recommend.",1,US,"March 12, 2021"
"After waiting over an hour and half to pick up my reservation, I was told that I could not use my debit card to secure my reservation (which was not told to me at any point during the reservation making process). Used my boyfriends credit card to secure the reservation, and was NOT informed that he had to be added on as a second driver to the reservation. Once the car was returned, we were charged an extra $85. I had to call to ask what this charge was for and, after waiting on hold for 2 hours, was told that since he was an additional driver, we we were charged extra. None of these extra fees were disclosed to me when paying for this reservation or adding a different credit card on file in case of damages. ""Customer Service"" was a joke and could do nothing to help me in this regard, only told me that I should've known about this policy from their website. Very unhelpful.

A pair of sunglasses was left in the rental, and I purchased the label I was told to in order for them to send the glasses back to me. That was over a month ago, and it's been excuse after excuse.

"Had rude customer service at pick-up, was very unfriendly both at counter and checking out of the rental. Could not extend my rental online when I could not return the vehicle due to bad weather. Tried calling several times and had a 30 minutes hold time. The call would get disconnected at 15 minutes everytime I called. I sent messages online as well with no response with my phone number. You can imagine my frustration getting stuck in San Antonio due to bad weather and then dealing with this. I had no power to keep my phone charged to call half the week or check my email but still attempted to get in touch with someone from your company. All hwys were closed in San Antonio so there was no way to return the car. Also the Airport was shutdown several days as well. I was still charged 8 days extra and late fees. I attempted to call to speak with someone when I returned  the car and ran into the same issue of not getting in touch with anyone. Sent two more emails and was generous to wait a week for a response and got nothing back. Oh but wait I got a text for a survey and an email...go figure!! I just honestly wish you would of worked with the individuals that got stranded in Texas due to the weather. I was fine paying for the 8 days at the same rate as the two weeks I had the car. You should not charge late fees when it is out of the person's control. I didn't receive a call the entire week and I definitely couldn't get in touch with anybody to extend the rental.",1,US,"March 03, 2021"
"My experience was very good with Fox Rent a Car. I was concerned after reading the reviews with multiple issues while renting with Fox Rent a Car.  I did purchase the Priority Pass as one of the complaints was a long wait.  This did not save me time on this rental as there was not a line but I will purchase again because if there is a line it would save time. The two issues I would warn customers about is insurance and tolls.  I brought my own transponder for the tolls.  Also, look at your rental agreement before going to your car to make sure they did not add the insurance if you don't want it.  In my case the insurance was added to the rental agreement without asking. I was also given a summary of charges printed after the rental agreement which did not have the insurance on it.  I did not notice this until a few days into my rental.  I called the customer service number, on hold for 45 minutes, and was told they could not take it off and only the location could, but would put a note on my account. When I returned the vehicle I said to not close the rental agreement until I talked with a manger about the insurance. I was sent inside and was able to get the insurance taken off because of the summary of charges I received without the insurance and the fact I had called in. Would have been a lot easier to look at the actual rental agreement and address the issue right away.The vehicle I received was clean and in good driving condition.I definitely will rent with Fox Rent a Car in the future based on this experience.The shuttle driver was very helpful in loading and unloading our luggage and gave us directions to the airline we were traveling on.  I actually preferred renting from an offsite location as the pickup area was easy to find and a lot less traffic.",5,US,"February 27, 2021"

In addition, he was on his mobile phone on a personal call while belittling my husband.  My husband also noticed several cars where dented and scratched.

It’s not exaggerating to say Fox is the worst company of any kinds by far I have ever dealt in my 30+ years travel history.1.	It took almost 3 hours to get the car: more than 2 hours waiting in the line and additional 40 minutes for the car to be ready. This did not include about 30 min waiting for the shuttle. When the shuttle was finally coming, it is small, old and dirty, nowhere close to those of other companies that had come and gone at least 4 times during my waiting. 2.	The price shown at Rentalcars.com is a trap. I ended up paid more than twice the reservation price because they said the small 2WD Mitsubishi Outlander Sports is the similar car to Jeep Grand Cherokee I booked. The retail price of Grand Cherokee is almost twice that of Outlander Sports. I had to pay a large amount of extra to get a slightly larger AWD car. Other companies also play the same trick but none to this extreme. I rented a Nissan Maxima from Avis before. They gave me a Chrysler 300. It was not what I wanted but not far off. Regulators should crack down this practice to force rental company list all their “similar” cars. 3.	The car I finally got had several serious problems. The right-side head light was not on. The “low tire pressure” light initiated after about 5-mile drive. The driver side wipe is in such bad condition that the windshield was completely blocked after anti-freeze wash. I had to stop at an auto part store to replace the wipe blander myself. I haven’t mention that the car was very dirty and had 90,000 miles on it. 4.	The staff are rude and unfriendly. They tried hard to sell you various of useless items. For example, a toll pass costs $17 a day. Colorado doesn’t have toll road. Only car pool lanes around Denver area used to charged fees but no longer now.I regret that I didn’t check reviews. It is the lowest rated company. Its high score reviews are most likely fakes. When I was returning the car, I saw two other customers were complaining. I strongly discourage anyone from using this company.",1,US,"January 26, 2021"
If I could give a zero I would. This company has more underlying fees and rip off policies the discount isn't worth it. Trust me your credit or bank account will be messed up if you rent from them. If you aren't pleased they are not willing to give a refund. If you cancel after booking you just loose your money. They are misleading the customers with the security deposit. Instead of them out right saying that they are charging $500. It first states that you need $150 for the deposit then ar the end of all these other states it has the $500 cost but the way that its posted looks like certain states only pays $150. They are charging some people $150 and others $500. I contacted customer service via email after posting my first site review and I got nothing but the cold shoulder and the same misleading post that is at the counter and on the website. I'm so happy that the Representative responded in his own words if you return the vehicle there are no refunds. The vehicle that I have is swaying in the rear-end and I believe that it is the tires. Feels like the belts are broken in the tire. Please please don't rent not a door knob from these people. I will be taking my complaint to BBB and the news this has to stop!!!,1,US,"January 26, 2021"
"Rented a car from Fox for $33.21 a day for 3-days. With fees the total was $158.49. I elected to pay at the counter during pickup, so Fox charged me a $150.00 security deposit which I didn't like but since it was ""refundable"" agreed. Turned the car in with no damage. Deposit was not returned. Fox says it was part of the rental, BS!! Clerk at booking said it was refundable. Never will rent from them again. Watch for hidden fees and don't trust what they say!Update: Fox replied to my negative review, stating they would review my issue. I emailed FOX as requested - no response!! My one star review stands!!",1,US,"January 25, 2021"
"OMG...I booked this car rental online, to pick up in Fort Lauderdale, my first time dealing with Fox Car Rental. First we finally get a bus ride to the car rental area, that is not in the terminal, but in a different area of the airport grounds. We stood in line for 1 & 1/2 hours to get our car. The sales people BS their way through the rental process, trying to act like they’re doing you some huge favors, but don’t let them fool you, they are out to screw you!! My estimated total when I booked the car was $246....Our total was over DOUBLE,  our credit card was charged $528!!! What a total rip-off! Luckily my boss had pre-warned me about the toll pass they try to talk you into getting. FYI their toll pass is $15/day FIFTEEN DOLLARS! That is a total of $105 for 7 days. I took my bosses SunPass and spent a total of $7.25, driving down to the keys & back. Beware of the LDW, that’s where they got us, that is the Loss Damage Waiver....that cost us just under $200 for the week! That’s what I get for trying to save some money.....HA!!         YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!Update: Fox came through for us and made it              right!",5,US,"January 25, 2021"
"Fox Rental Cars: After doing my research on rental car companies in Puerto Vallarta to make sure I picked a reliable company, I reserved a Full Size Van for my group of 12 people, I even called to talk with someone to make sure that is what we were getting.  When we arrived they told us they didn't have any full size vans! They gave us a Minivan instead, so half of our group had to take a Taxi.  we drove 6 miles down the road and the minivan broke down, so they came to us with a Suzuki SUV, which can only hold 4 people with luggage or 6 without luggage, so we had to call another cab.  This might not be such a big deal if we were staying close to town, but the house we rented was in Marina Chacala, a 2 hour drive north of Puerto Vallarta.  We ended up spending more on Taxi's than we spend on the rental car plus we still had to pay full price for a little economy car, they would not adjust the price when we checked out.  I would never recommend this company to anyone and don't get me started on their insurance scam, steer clear of these people!!!  We were not happy!Update: as of 2/3/21 I still have not heard back from Fox, so their reply to this post was just lip service! Run don't walk away from doing business with this company!!",1,PL,"January 20, 2021"
"Fox Rent a Car at Denver DEN airport.Let me say I made more than 50 car rentals in the USA since 2015 from several companies and I noted some bigger or minor issues but this particular location is exceptional - in negative meaning.This time I made reservation thru ""Wisecars"" (for first and last time I believe). Here is briefly my experience:- it takes forever to get to Fox place as they have tiny shuttle that pops up once an hour at airport; others rental places buses pop up every 10-15 minutes!- there was no car as reserved at place upon arrival, had to upgrade what did cost me significantly more comparing to Wisecars voucher- there are number of extra fees listed that must be paid if you want to pickup a car- car was dirty outside and inside, with missing items; looked like sb dropped it a minute before my pickup; fortunately I bought full insurance from rental place what saved me troubles when returning as there was lots of damages on the car under that dirt- Fox facility at DEN is awful - below any acceptable level; seems they try to maximize their profit keeping everything at minimum cost- last but not least - it is not cheap place, renting from them costs same as from Hertz or Avis hence it makes no sense as others have better service and better facilities.I understand there was big load at day I was over there but this is not a good excuse as i.e. NY Kennedy rental places do far better job no matter how busy days are.Finally I must say that front desk people were OK (a lady who serviced me was really helpful) and seemed embarrassed with all that mess. Hence I put two stars instead of zero. New management is required over DEN Fox Rent a Car!Edit (after reply from Fox):Thanks for reply but I see no reason to contact your customer service. Deal was made, I signed contract agreeing to terms and conditions (and to all additional fees), paid for that rent to get a car to continue travelling so what can be done now?",2,US,"January 19, 2021"
"This place is a rip off.First  your quote is a great deal then you get your bill and its one hundred dollars more than the quote.We had to stand in line for 11/2 hours to get a car.like I said when they give you a quote that should be the priceThey added extras I never heard of.I am in the process of disputing this pitiful company.I have called customer service for three days in a row and everyday two hours of waiting they say there are 10 callers ahead of you.What does that tell you ?As of 1/27 Fox has contacted me and we resolved all issues and I have to say I was pleased with the outcome.Thank youNext problem, told Fox I had a Surpass for florida and low and behold I was charged $16 on my charge card for tolls.I see its also written on my agreement I have a Sunpass.  Surpass also charged the same amount.I will never again in this lifetime use FOX",1,US,"January 18, 2021"
"I gave one star because zero was not an option.  DO NOT GO HERE. Yes, it is cheap, but you will regret it. First car died on the side of the road.  3.5 hours, no tow truck. Got second car 12 hours later.  Front tires 100% bald in a mountain town.  They are trying to kill me.  I mean baby's butt bald.  not a hint of tread.  Do not do this.  Pay more but live.",1,US,"January 18, 2021"
"Booked through Southwest airlines at Denver Airport for Dec 24-28/2020. Reservation said 'Grand Cherokee or similar'. They gave us a tiny suv that could only fit 2 bags. It was old with scuffed up seats. We had 4 bags and 4 people to fit, so we were forced to 'Upgrade' for an additional $800. Double the original amount. Beware of these scammers!!!!",1,US,"January 15, 2021"
"Worst car rental experience I have ever had.  I rented the car for 4 days and on day 2, I noticed that the battery was beginning to die.  It was taking longer and longer to turn over every time that I started it.  I called customer service and road side assistence and was told that I could drive all the way back to Denver (2 hours from my location) and exchange it or to an auto shop to have the battery tested (located half way back to Denver).  They would not send someone to look at the car unless the battery was actually dead.  I only needed to start it one more time to get to the airport the following morning but had to leave at 6 am to make it on time.  So I woke up an hour earlier, knowing it wouldn't start, and it didn't.  I called road side assistance to get a jump but was on hold for over 40 min.  Finally had to wake up a random neighbor to help me.  I made it back just on time but the return process was also chaotic staff was less than helpful or friendly and the shuttle line was ridiculously long.  Ended up calling an Uber to make my flight just on time.  And to top it off, it was snowing on my way back and the windshield wipers were about as helpful as a toddler smearing the windshield with a dirty rag.  Never again.",1,N/A,"January 14, 2021"
"We rented a car at the Phoenix airport to drive to Yuma. We had a flat tire, and there was NO TIRE IRON OR JACK! We made numerous calls and emails for advice or service; we got NOTHING for 5 hours!!! We didn’t want to drive a car with no jack. We contacted Fox roadside assistance. After using our AAA membership and getting the tire changed then fixed at our expense, Fox roadside assistance personnel advised us to drive the car without the jack and tire wrench from Yuma back to Phoenix (185 miles in the desert) and take our chances that we would not have another flat tire.  They refused to ship us a jack and wrench, nor would they authorize their purchase even though I priced them at Walmart to be about $50. They said that if we have a flat, they would send roadside service. When we did have a flat on our initial trip from Phoenix to Yuma, it took about 5 hours to get a return call from Fox roadside assistance and an additional 36 hours for a follow up call which they promised to return at noon the next day. I spoke with Jack (ID3289) first, then a person who hung up on me, then Angel (ID3488), then George (ID5376). No one would provide a phone number for the Phoenix office or provide an acceptable remedy for driving the car back to Phoenix from Yuma. I simply wanted authorization to buy a jack and wrench at my expense and get reimbursed for the cost. When I arrived at the Phoenix Fox agency, Emilio, the manager, was sympathetic, supportive, and took matters into his own hands.  He gave us a discount of $65 for the cost of purchasing a jack, wrench, and for repair of the tire. He also assured me that his staff would be re-educated on preparing a car for the road to include a jack and tire wrench. Thank goodness for Emilio! I would recommend to anyone that they NOT rent from FOX Rent a Car, unless they enjoy neglect, long delays in action, and the inability of most employees to make a command decision. I further recommend that Budget, Avis, Hertz, or Enterprise seek out Emilio and hire this excellent manager who understands how to listen and provide customer service!",1,DE,"January 11, 2021"
"(a scandal I need to rate 1 star instead of 0 stars, in order to alert all of you!)This is an organized group of professionally trained people, whose aim is to deceive you and steal your money.For the second time in a row, we fell again into this defrauding companyFox rental a car robbed us money and there IS NO WAY to get in contact with anyone: customer service Email (billing at foxrentacar.com, customer centers, ....) Face book,  Websites, call center, …. (they actively use the technique of Ignore, avoid and Denial).Please note that the billing department (billing at foxrentacar.com) has no idea about what happened, so waiting in the line for >30 minutes will just be a waste of your time: Fox Las Vegas swapped the original contract and gave us a different one. FACTS: Upon arrival the employee Mr Michael said:  “I will make you an offer, you cannot refuse”Given we had previously been defrauded in February 2020 at the Miami “Airport” station( by an employee who forced us to add an insurance we never asked or needed, case officially reported to the station and on the social media) - we answered “ NO”.But then he added: “you should trust me, If you return the car empty, it costs you only 3US$ to refuel the car.After returning it with some fuel, we were (obviously) charged for the whole missing fuel. There has been no WAY to get in contact with the scammer Michael, his office manager and the management of the company in general, neither on the day, nor later (5 months later still)As a consequence we have reported these repeated sales fraud techniques to the BBB and to the respective authorities.Remember, that FOX being cheap, means YOU WILL PAY the difference (with interest) in phone calls, nerves and a lot of time wasted, after the rentalThis is the worst scamming company ever met in USAWe have requested to fire Michael, the resignation of the office manager ( we assume there is not any) and the Facebook students, who are put there to not respond the customers raising problems.Note: The company has often asked us to contact billing at foxrentacar.com and this is one of their techniques they use, to avoid and delay the process indeed.Short note on reaching the station:When you land at the airport, there is NO Fox car rental.  You need to wait for a bus at least 20 minutes, drive additional 20 minutes to a station. Still this is NOT where FOX is: you need to wait for a SECOND bus (no air conditioning and no social distancing so to better spread COV19) and after a journey in 120F, you get to their third world location.After that, HELL will begin with FOX Rent a CAR",1,GB,"January 10, 2021"

"I rented a car for one week. I was able to avoid tolls except for one, there was no cash toll plaza. A few weeks later I received a bill - $1 toll, turned into a $16 bill. Fox charged a $15 administrative fee. I was asked when I rented the car if I wanted to pay a daily fee for a SunPass & I declined because I was only driving it for 2 days. I will never use this company again, the car was very worn and I don't like the fact that I don't have the option to pay my bill without an extortion fee of $15.Update:  I called the # and was able to have the administrative fee waived as a one time courtesy since it was only one charge. All is good now,  thank you. Advice for the future: Avoid tolls, especially now adays where some toll plazas don't accept cash payments any longer.",1,US,"December 30, 2020"
"I ordered a car on december 4th through priceline thinking I was protected. On that day I was charged $220 thinking I got a great deal. Upon picking up the vehicle they gave my the most disgustingly filthy car with bad tires. When I refused that car they gave me an ""upgrade"" of which I was then charged for. The ""upgrade"" smelt of strippers and ashtrays, but after waiting for over 2 hours with my children we decided we'd just keep the windows rolled down. On our drive my 7 year old daughter found a razor blade and some peanut butter in the backseat. What ever. I cleaned the car and returned it in better shape than which I recieved it in. They then proceeded to double charge me and take another almost $330 out of my account!! Of course I can't get anyone on the phone.

Hidden charges; no way will I rent from them again.  Upon arrival, I was offered a ""free"" upgrade.  After returning the car, I was charged an additional $30 + taxes for the upgrade.  The car was supposedly equipped with an EZ Pass which I did not even see and did not request,  It was not needed as we did not go through any toll areas.  I was charged $35 + taxes for this on the final bill.  Fort Myers, Florida Airport location.  Stay away from Fox.  I would give less than 1 Star if I could.",1,US,"December 28, 2020"
"I have no idea why anyone would rate this company with 4 stars.  They hardly deserve 1 star.  I have rented from this company, and its sister company, Ace, several times, because of their low prices, which are significantly lower than most of the next lowest prices.  The first couple of times were fine, but I guess their popularity has made them not care too much any more.  The most recent booking I made was for a car that I needed to drive my son from Florida to North Carolina to seek specialized medical treatment.  After waiting on line at Hollywood-Ft. Lauderdale airport for over an hour, I get to the reservation desk and the clerk tells me he can't give me the car because due to COVID they are not allowing any cars to go out of state, and that, further, if I drove the car out of state, it would turn itself off and report itself stolen.  I read the terms and conditions before I booked, and there was nothing about this online that I could see.  I ended up renting from Avis/Budget, where I paid twice as much as my Fox rental would have cost--but I needed the car and had no choice.  If I had booked with Budget to begin with, it would have cost more than Fox, but the aggravation would have been far less.The last time, with Ace, they made me buy their extra insurance, citing some regulation that no one else had mentioned, requiring renters to prove that they have $100,000 in coverage.  Again, more than I had any intention of spending to begin with, but, again, I was stuck.I am furious and disgusted, and I will never rent from them again.",1,US,"December 22, 2020"

"I rented a car from Fox Car rental from the Miami location. The rate for the car was reasonable, so I reserved a vehicle. Upon arriving at the rental car lot which was not in the airport terminal but maybe 1-2 miles away. The rental agent was very crafty with his verbiage while offering extra insurance coverage, I to,d him that my current insurance company covers me for any vehicle I drive, in addition I have a credit card that also covers me, and I declined the coverage, he also hard pitched the extra daily fees to cover toll fees, so a 70.00 rental was estimated to be 150.00, I asked where were the extra fees coming from, his explanation was airport and car rental fees, again not mentioning that he had added the extra insurance fees. Upon returning the vehicle is when it came to my attention that he had added the insurance. I asked them to remove it, and refund those insurance fees, I was told that I needed to call their billing department, at this time they weren’t open due to them having pacific west coast hours and it was 7am east coast time, long story condensed, I called for two days waiting hours in a call que to never reach anyone to have them to refund the overcharge of them adding the insurance that I declined, I got so frustrated that I simply called my credit card company and disputed the overcharge and let then handle it. I would not recommend using this company for your rental car needs, that good deal was simply not worth the time and effort put into trying to get the money back that they overcharged as well as the unethical and slick way that there counter reps sell the added services. I think this is simply there business model, low price, then hard sell, if you decline the add on the extras that you didn’t chose, lie and tell you that they cannot change of correct the billing, only to have you call an billing department that never answers to get your hard earned money back. I tried supporting the little independent rental car companies, won’t do that again, nor will ever use Fox Car Rental ever again, the cost to acquire new clients is high I tried them without them using any marketing dollars and they blew it, and could have had a long term corporate and personal renter.",1,US,"December 15, 2020"
"Absolutely the worst rental car experience i have ever had, by far! Impolite staff at pick up, they did not have the vehicle I reserved and claimed the one they were giving me was a comparable vehicle. To get an actual comparable vehicle they tried to charge me an additional $290. Finally gave up and left with the smaller, non 4x4 vehicle. Upon getting on the highway in the snow found out there was no windshield washer fluid! Pulled off and picked some up, then realized the washer spray nozzles shot off to the sides of the car not even hitting the windshield, had to wedge a pen cap under each nozzle to get them to hit the windshield. Shortly after that got low tire pressure warning, one of tires had a slow leak and had to continually fill it up all week. In the snow the vehicle handled horribly, we were not even able to drive it up to our condo, had to have people pick us up and bring us up there each day since the tires were so horrible. Finally on the shuttle back to the airport the shuttle driver tried to cram people into the shuttle ignoring the signs with the closed seats. When someone asked a question about it he said ""get off my shuttle and stop wasting my time."" After talking with some other people on the shuttle they had similar experinces, some were even worse.

"I have rented from Fox 3 xs in the last 3 months.  I have rented through ""wisecars.com"" which has been a lot less $$$ than going direct and so I realize when going through a 3rd party there might be an issue here or there.  The last 2 times at Fox the price I was quoted from Wisecar was different than what they charged me at Fox. It was like $6-7 difference and I didn't feel like arguing about it.  The customer service agent at Fox told me to take it up with Wisecar.  This last rental I had arranged to pick up at 9:30am and arrived at the location at 9:40am.  I was checked in right away and given an ""upgrade"".  Well the reason I was upgraded was because they literally had no vehicles ready or clean.  They spent 25 minutes washing my rental and did a pretty poor job of it at that.  On the upside.  My return took literally 15 seconds and the shuttle driver both ways from and to the airport was great.  I will rent again as I am saving 30-40% over regular rates.

Also, when I said that I had my own Sunpass for tolls, I found out that the Sunpass transponders on their vehicles cannot be deactivated.  Therefore, I would not be able to use my own Sunpass, WOULD BE CHARGED FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EACH TOLL, or would be forced to change my routes in order to avoid any tolls.  I can only imagine how many tourists have become their victims on the Sunpass Scheme of $15.00 PER TOLL.  I doubt that they inform the tourists about the toll charges before they drive out.",1,US,"November 23, 2020"
"First car we rented smelled like body odor. It had 77000 miles on it.  Battery died out in the middle of nowhere.  tow truck driver said battery was shot.  Returned it and got another smelly rental, cigerettes this time.  Had 22000 miles on it.  OK car.  Had to wait in line for 1 hr and 45 minutes to get first car.  The clerk at counter  was busy singing to the music on her radio. This place should be shut down.  Both cars windows were filthy.",1,US,"November 20, 2020"
"I rented a car from Fox Rent a Car in October 2020.  It took appx. 30 mins at the rental counter in Orlando. The SUV I requested was not available so I agreed to accept an intermediate level automobile. The car reeked of cigarette smell! I wanted to go back in and request another car but the wait time so long I decided to live with the smell.  I drove through toll roads on my trip. During Covid, all toll plazas do not accept cash so I knew they would bill me via my credit card. I was shocked when I received a bill for an additional $ 60.00 for ""administrative fees"" for tolls totaling $ 7.25! Since Covid, no rental cars companies are charging this fee! I called and the customer service rep dropped the fee to $15 plus tolls. Of course, I would pay the tolls but the additional fee is ludicrous!",2,US,"November 18, 2020"
"Rented a car for 4 days, they cancelled the reservation on us because we were late, (Flight). Then charged us double the price...then gave us a dirty car and when I say dirty, not the outside, food all over the seats, the smell was so bad we stopped at a store to get Lysol spray and Febreze, nothing was wiped down, you could see finger prints everywhere, also needed Lysol wipes (Covid), not to mention the person waiting on us was rude because God forbid we took a moment to decide what to do (be without a car at Denver Airport)",1,US,"November 17, 2020"

Later I noticed a big dent in the back passenger side of the car.  I returned the car with 3/4 tan of gas.  I was charged $248 after I returned home!!!

"As many peeps commented before, the wait time to get the rental even with a reservation is unacceptable. We picked our car up in Las Vegas where the Fox location is far out from the airport. With taking two shuttles it takes about 30 minutes to get there. From there we waited over two hours to finally get the booked car. The car was clean and ok with 74,000 miles on it.

I called her on it and she said "" oh , i have it and pulled it out of her pocket.  Not the same as wearing it!""  finally got the car ( 1 of very few left that day ) and it was dirty, barely full with gas and more importantly had a tire fault light on.

Three hours to get a car.   35 minutes wait for the shuttle.  2 hours in the line of 42 people. Car was given to us not even clean. Worst car rental experience ever.,1,US,"October 16, 2020"
"I flew into Denver and saw all the other companies had like 3 or 4 nice shuttles about every 5 min come to pick up its customers. Fox was the ugly stepchild. The shuttle looked like it was going to break down and burn up with everyone in it. We get dropped off and oh my god did we wait. An hour and a half just to be seen, standing. They slipped in every other extra they could try to bill for, and it took forever just to get the vehicle. Pre pay for gas is never cheaper and if you don't fill it they will charge 7.99 a gal. We got our Jeep which is apparently pretty rare. It was all beat up and we took so many videos. The ability to change a spare didn't exist as the jack was missing and the spare was flat. We were going to be driving a lot so I had to fix it and get a jack. Return was just as crazy but thankfully we were only there for 30 min. Check Google reviews.  I would have gladly went to any other company and paid so I didn't wait in line. I will never use them again.",1,N/A,"October 15, 2020"

"This was by far the worst experience I’ve had with a rental company! We flew from Atlanta to Denver for our honeymoon moon on 10/4/20. Upon arriving at the Denver fox car location, at 6pm we stood in line for two and a half hours. They had me sign the pre trip inspection form before I ever laid eyes on the rental. After realizing how bad of a spot I was putting myself in after seeing the rental they were trying to give me (scratched, dented, had trash and plastic bottles inside, hadn’t even been washed) I went back in demanded for a new inspection slip, and manager after telling them I would file suit, they put put us in a descent Durango. They took $250 out for a deposit and only refunded half of it back. Do not use this company! PLEASE. Even if you’ve booked through Priceline as I did, just write it off as a loss and go to enterprise. I’m telling you they will get you! Period. I have video documentation of the whole event, we started recording after seeing over 7 other customers having similar issues!",1,US,"October 13, 2020"
"Several years ago I rented from FOX and had a bad experience (dirty car, broken interior parts, etc.) I have them the benefit of the doubt, allowing that it may have been a fluke, and recently rented with them again. Or, should I say, I PAID to rent with them but after arriving on my late-evening flight with my young daughter, I was told they had no more cars left. I was not the only customer to receive this surprising news. There were at least a dozen people in line, who all patiently waited for approximately 30 minutes before the manager FINALLY came out to explain the situation. The manager promised that we would be given refunds and that she would pay for us to take Uber/Lyft to our destinations. She explained that we could return the next day, when they MIGHT have some cars available. Given that I was with my young daughter, that it was 10:00 p.m. and that we were staying 45 minutes from the airport (and only for two nights), returning the next morning only to wait in another long line seemed absurd. The manager then directed me and other pre-paid customers to go ""rent from Budget or Avis."" Luckily, Avis was open and still had cars available. Of course, the cost was more and the FOX manager did not offer to cover the difference. After returning from my trip, I attempted to contact FOX, since I had not seen a reversal of charges on my credit card statement. I called three separate times and had to end the calls due to the extreme wait times. Finally, I just called my credit card company to reverse the charges and to investigate the issue on their own. Since a company cannot charge for a product they did not provide, I'm confident that they will find in my favor. At the end of the day, I am disgusted by FOX and the abysmal customer service and irresponsible business practices. Leaving dozens of customers (several of whom had pre-paid) in the lurch late at night is unconscionable. And, FOX can skip the ""please call customer service"" pat response. Not only do I not care to speak with them, I wouldn't be able to get through anyway.",1,US,"October 13, 2020"
"A total disappointment to me and my daughters - I had to cancel my bi-weekly visit because of Fox Rent a Car. Someone 'forgot' to make it clear you cannot drive beyond states with a common border with Illinois. Besides wasting my time getting to the rental, I had to spend more money than planned to get back to my family. I wonder why the first time I rented a car with Fox they didn't have a problem with me going to Ohio. Never again!",1,US,"October 12, 2020"
I am honestly appalled at how badly this company treated me and my family. they left us STRANDED at the airport with no car because we were 4 MINUTES LATE. They claimed to “no longer have the car” that we reserved. Obvious bull $hit seeing as there’s no way they could’ve given our car away in 4 fücking minutes. they offered to get us a car if we payed an extra $200 !!!!! never use this service it will only give you a bad start to your trip.,1,US,"October 10, 2020"

Worst service EVER! Do not use this company.  Our rental is stranded in Calistoga due to an emergency evacuation from wildfires.  Per local sheriffs office no one is allowed in to the area and our flight leaves today out of San Francisco.  Have been speaking with Fox rental throughout the week about the situation and they said not to worry but hours before we leave they now say we will be charged each day it is left there and will eventually have to pay a towing fee!!

"If I could give them less than one star I would. After a debacle where we landed and they said they were sold out of cars when we already paid in full through priceline?? Then the manager walked up, said let me go see what I have in the back. He was able to produce a lesser vehicle than what was paid for but threw in a ""free tank of gas"" I was okay with it and gave them the benefit of the doubt that they were a good company. WRONG! I have been calling and emailing continuously trying to get in touch with the Denver location. I mistakenly left my prescription sunglasses in the vehicle. It has now been two weeks with no response. I have tried to get the matter escalated but their customer service has not format of escalation. They can just ""send emails"" to the location and ""they will get back to me"". Which obviously is to much to ask. I wouldn't be so upset if these were cheap regular sunglasses.. The customer service rep informed me they only keep the item 30 days so the clock is ticking.",1,US,"September 25, 2020"

"DO NOT rent from Fox! They do not care about their customers! They will cheat anyone off their rentals any given opportunity and by the looks of it, they do it so often their reps just take heat from the angry customers! they already know what to say to unhappy customers, which is to blame it on their policy! they’re policy includes not caring to resolve customers issues! To do a simple date change, you, the customer has to go back into the system, for whatever reason they can’t do it over the phone, cancel your existing rental, then when you rebook for the correct reservation, you have to pay another $400 deposit instead of being able to use the existing deposit! This company is clearly owned by scammers and will never go back here and will tell everyone to never come here!**Update** After receiving yet another rehearsed response to a customer issue, speaking with another rep will only make the matters worse. If Fox Rental wants to fix this, then a decision maker needs to get in contact with me and resolve my issue. Otherwise it is pointless and I can move forward accepting Fox rental is just a big scam!",1,US,"September 22, 2020"
"I made reservation for a Fox car through for a five-day rental period. The rental fee for five days is total $269. The leasing agreement stated that if the car cannot be returned on time, a daily fee of $37/day will be charged for later return. Due to the business reason, I extended the two-day lease. When I returned the car, Fox charged 327.07$ for late return. It is not as agreement state 37$/day ( 2 days should be only 74 $) A total of 687.06 USD charged on my credit card. When I went to the Fox front to ask the reason, they explain many reason and gave me the billing account phone number because I was rush to take my flight. I could not got some one help on the phone after more than 40 minutes waiting. When I rent the care, I declare that I have my own insurance to cover the protection. I need not purchase any insurance.

"The car was fine - except it came with a left blinker light out and it smelled really funky.  My issue is with the person who checked us in.  He asked where we were going and I told him Colorado Springs. He told me the car needed the toll transponder.  There was no options except to get the $15 fee for not having a transponder and the $11.99/day was a better deal.  I asked specifically if we would have tolls to COS and he said yes.  So we agreed.

"I used Fox Rent A Car on August 7th in Tampa, FL. I arrived around midnight that Friday morning exhausted to be told I had to put down a $400 deposit. No where on any site does it state the amount for the deposit just that we needed to make sure to bring our photo ID and the card that would be used. After having to pay way more out of pocket than we should have, when we came back to check the car in they tell us everything checks out good not a lot of gas was used and the car was clean. We should be getting a confirmation email for drop off (which was never received) but the total was $321! When I initially put in the reservation my total which stated ACTUAL total included taxes and other cost was $162.24. I contacted customer service the next morning which I was on hold for well over an hour to have a rude representative explain to me what I had already knew as if I was bothering him. I was told that I left the car on E which was far from the truth, I asked for them to remove the Sunpass from the contract as I only used 2 tolls that equaled less than $10. I was not going to pay $40 for $10 worth of tolls, completely absurd. The representative told me if I didn't pay the toll when I received it by mail that I would be charged a fee from the rental agency, so the representative assumed I was not going to pay the toll. A month later I have yet to receive the invoice for these tolls I used back in August. I have been on hold a majority of my day (while at work) to try and hunt down this invoice as Sunpass cannot help me since the car is registered to Fox Rent A Car. I am currently on hold as I am writing this for about an hour for a simple request to avoid an obscene charge for tolls that again do not amount more than $10. DO NOT USE THIS RENTAL AGENCY. They are rude when they do finally answer the phone and do not explain anything.",1,US,"September 15, 2020"

"Employees ransacked my cooler that I left in the car (beware of thieves)! I had an exhausting and long drive when I returned the car full of fuel and completely clean, but left behind a cooler and a painting in the back seat. Calling customer service was/is a joke, good luck trying to speak with a human. Ended up having to go back to the rental drop off, first person said nothing was found, escalated it to a manager who said it might be there and was able to find it. When I checked to cooler after I returned home I noticed a measuring scale I use for baking was stolen along with some produce. FOX has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE btw, when you talk to someone they just send off a ticket and “do their job” which does not equate to actually helping you. I don’t think the rental contract says they promise to not steal lost & found items or that they have human decency.

I paid for a specific car they gave me another because I’mNot big on complaining i said sure I’m just ready to vacation . So i got outside i asked the girl outside the same questions i asked inside to the high ups she told me different . Basically i had an early flight and they didn’t open early so i kept asking will there be a shuttle bc clearly i have no other way to get back to the airport , their best answer was just get 2 hotels one closer to the airport and shuttle with who they have but listen to this they had a fee for returning the car early but she suggested i return it early and don’t worry about the 25$ Fee . Do i look stupid ??? Then the high up was like “i mean who books a 6:45 am flight ?!” As if i might not have a life to get back to y’all are trash I’m so disappointed in Priceline for choosing y’all NEVER AGAIN !

"This has been the worst rental car experience I have ever had in my more than 50 years of renting automobiles all around the world. First, my initial Fox Renal Car reservation (confirmation #FFX0013685F) was cancelled wrongly, then I was charged $300+ more than my original Reservation agreement and given a lessor car. I was then sent a text saying my rental car was 5 or more days over-due & threatened with legal action.  It was virtually impossible to get in touch with a live agent (2+ hours on hold); and then it took another day to have Fox acknowledge it was their error but offer no compensation. The two cars I rented from Fox in Seattle this summer were ill kept, not cleaned (empty food containers under seats, filthy windows, very high mileage, etc.).  Certainly not cleaned and sanitized to Covid standards. This entire rental experience has been unsatisfactory.",1,US,"August 28, 2020"
"always read reviews thinking people are exaggerating, but wow..this place SUCKED. I’ve used Fox before in Arizona but this experience was on another level. I will echo everyone else in saying DO NOT TRY TO SAVE MONEY BY USING THIS COMPANY. Go with Avis, Hertz, Enterprise, ANYONE ELSE! DO NOT EXPECT THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE TO BE HELPFUL. DO NOT EXPECT THEIR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE TO ASSIST YOU WHEN YOU'RE IN NEED. I don’t know where to start. I had a bad feeling about this location as soon as I got there to pick up the car. We rented a black 2017 Jeep Renegade with 53k. The person who helped us when we picked up the car blew through the information and kept trying to upsell us on packages and items without real explanation of the products. A few days into our trip, we were on the road in Idaho where we ended up getting a flat tire. We took the car to a small tire shop and they said the car was unsafe to drive and to try a larger tire shop in the area the following day. That evening, I called Roadside Assistance, Customer Support and any other number that was listed on the paperwork we received. We waited 3 hours to get in touch with someone from their roadside assistance at 6 pm MDT  to only be transferred and disconnected in a matter of 5 minutes with no help whatsoever. I reached out to their social media pages as well and was told that their roadside assistance was 24/7... which didn’t seem to be the case. The next day we took the car to a Les Schwab because we could drive on a flat and they informed us the same thing. The car tires were extremely bald and that one of the tire’s inner wires were showing. I got on the phone finally with a Fox Rent A Car Roadside Assistance rep who was so nice! He informed me that Fox Rent A Car would reimburse me for four new tires. He said that I would have to pay for them on my own because Les Schwab was not one of their vendors and then I’d get reimbursed by Fox Rent A Car and that the SLC location knew about the issue. I received an email of this confirmation information from their rep and went forward with the purchase of tires. We continued our trip as planned and dropped the car off at the end of our trip. The person at the return area was nice and apologized on behalf of the company for the tires when I informed them of the issues we encountered. BUT when I got to the counter to talk to someone the woman said I needed to talk with her manager. She went to get him and he came out to talk with me. As soon as I explained the situation, Tim (no last name given) shut me down. He waved away my paperwork I received from Les Schwab, he also told he doesn’t handle reimbursements at his location that Roadside Assistance does, and he wouldn’t give him his business card. He said he had just moved into his office and didn’t have any. Which I find hard to believe when you were in the same office two weeks prior when I came to pick up the car. He also said he wouldn’t give me his first and last name because he doesn’t give that information out even though he’s the General Manager of the location and he said it was because he didn't want stalkers. He never once apologized for the situation or the condition of the car and basically told me to have a good day. I have emailed the roadside assistance rep back about reimbursement but I have no idea what the deal is with this company and I hope to somehow get reimbursed for tires I didn’t even get to keep. I had to contact my credit card to dispute the charges at this point, because they were so unhelpful. I feel bad for the employees that have to work under this Tim individual and this company.",1,US,"August 27, 2020"

We didn't realize this when we picked up the car and had to clean it The next day. The inside of the car is a clear covid violation. Then I dropped it off and the worker burned out in reverse. I got there at 530 and the shuttle didn't arrive until 643 am. I spoke to another customer that said they were waiting 45 minutes when I got there.Several people went inside to complain. The girl behind the counter had"" no idea""where the shuttle was. I missed my flight and had to pay an additional $200 for the next flight. I called to complain and could only speak to the finance department.All she said was that the shuttle is a complimentary service provided to the customers and that customers are ""educated"" on the web site that shuttles run every 15-30 min. She also said ""that's why the airports say get to the airport 2 hrs before your flight,so that you don't miss it"". Even if I got there earlier,I still would have missed my flight because there were people there waiting over an hour and a half for the shuttle. She also said that ""we are not responsible for extra payments from the airlines because you missed your flight"". This is a very calous attitude to have and poor customer service.

So again re-enforcing the fact that i will not be using this store credit from Fox Rent a Car, hence I WANT MY $437.00 REFUNDED TO ME IMMEDIATELYAs of today, 8/24/2020, Delta is furloughing 1941 pilots in October due to the fallout from the pandemic and plunging air travel demands,  Yet this lousy substandard low life fox rent a car still refuses to give me a full refund in lue of my store credit which i have that i will never use due to this pandemic.This is a terrible company, a true low life low life car rental companyThis is as of today, 8/20/20, on the news, and Fox Rent A Car still wont give me a full refund, even when i provide facts on why I and nobody else is traveling and have no need for a rental car!!!!WASHINGTON - American Airlines Group Inc said on Thursday it plans to suspend flights to 15 U.S. airports in October as travel demand remains low as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.Congress has been weighing for weeks whether to grant U.S. airlines another $25 billion in payroll assistance that would keep tens of thousands of airline workers on the job for another six months and extend minimum service requirements.American said it will cancel just over 700 flights in October to and from those 15 airports but warned it could make additional cuts or could reconsider if Congress provides more assistance.Looks like i received a reply from Fox Rent a car, today, 8/20/2020 to my original review, only to safe face. They state they will not issue me a full refund, can anyone out there help me on this issue and get me a full refund????here are the facts of this story:october 2019, i made a reservation for a rental car and was charged $437.00, i cancelled my trip to Phoenix for personal reasons and when i called for to request a refund, they said no, and issued me a store credit, but did refund my $150.00 deposit, But still charged me $437.00.so in March i reserved a car for my spring training baseball trip, well, spring training was called off due to the virus, then two days after that Phoenix was shut down, and soon after the whole country was closed down. On July 15, i finally got to speak with a representative from Fox Rent a Car, and i asked for a full refund of my $437.00, stating that i will not be travleling anywhere soon, due to these virus hot spots. Texas is a hot spot, Florida is a hot spot, California is shut down again, Phoenix is a hot spot.Fox flatly refuses to give me a credit for my $437.00, that i was originally charged for back in oct, 2019, on my credit card.I explained that American Airlines issued me a full refund for my March flight, they went out of their way to accommmodate everyone during this national pandemic. But this low life rental car still refuses to issue me a full refund, they put peoples safety, my safety, childrens safety from this virus above a lousy $437.00.This is a despicable rental car company, i advise everyone to get a car from many of the other companies, who now from the loss of business have very great rates and they are far superior to this sub par Fox Rent a car.Please post this on every social media outlet that you can, Fox Rental Car is taking advantage of this national virus pandemic, while people are dying as i type this review, just sickening isn't it?This is the worst rental car company i have ever witnessed, and i urge everyone to share this story, and do not ever rent anything from Fox Rent a Car, not even a Porta Potty.I will never use this store credit from this company, EVER, I will not be traveling until this virus is completely done,",1,US,"August 25, 2020"
"Honestly I don't know how this business has this many good reviews on this website....I recommend going to google reviews and see how many people were scammed by this company !! Here is our experience : If there were a zero option I would put that! I wish I googled this company before we rented from them. Like lots of people said, they charge you so much for insurance, and in our case, they charged us $350 deposit and never returned it back stating that we rented the car 5 days when we really did 2 days only! online you find a pretty cheap cost to rent a car, to us it was $12 a day, but when you go there, they charged us around $500 !!!! We rented this car for 2 days only, and they say it shows 5 day in their system! now we are trying to get through to customer service or billing and no one is answering . The system keeps saying there's this and this number of people in front of you , and you stay on hold for 2 hours , and that number never changes. As for me.....I will try to get my money back no matter how long it takes! Shame on you !!",1,US,"August 24, 2020"
"We made it to the rental location in Las Vegas at around 9:30 at night to find two people working the counter. One left after finishing with the customer she was with, saying she had done her 9 hours. That left one person working with customers and the line grew by the minute. The so called shift manager walked around cutting and laughing with other employees instead of helping. A lady in front of us demanded to see the manager which is we found out the young lady walking around was the shift manager. She explained they knew they were the only 24 hour rental agency in Las Vegas and she was trying to find help. She was not looking for help she was avoiding work. When we arrived to drop the car back off ten days later, the line was out the building again with people waiting outside in the heat. We wished them luck then climbed on the shuttle bus with others dropping off cars. A young lady customer had to go inside and demand a driver for the shuttle bus because she had a flight to catch. We will NEVER use Fox again. Horrible customer service and no accountability. We will stick with companies that actually use trained staff and are professional at all times. Fox is neither!",1,EG,"August 24, 2020"
"I left a bunch of stuff in the glove compartment cleaning out the car at the car rental drop off. I left 2 sets of AirPods in the glove compartment and they told me they didn’t see it, And the car was rented after I dropped it off dirty, total liars and thief’s",1,US,"August 23, 2020"
"I booked a rental car from Fox through Expedia. The rental was in Chicago, IL on 13 Jul to 20 Jul, 2020a) When I was at the rental booth the young lady asked if I want the Easy Pass for tolls. I told her no that I had change. She did not tell me the tolls booths were closed due to Covid-19. This cost me $175.00 in tolls and fines.b) I asked for the pre-paid fuel and she did not add that. This cost me another $55.93In general by her actions and others at Fox there is a lack of training and professionalism at this location.I WILL NEVER AGAIN RENT FROM FOX AND I RECOMMEND THAT YOU DON'T EITHER",1,US,"August 20, 2020"
"I recently rented a car from Fox out of Denver. The vehicle we had booked was given to someone else so I was given a Toyota 4Runner. I was thinking okay thats fine its bigger anyway and it will be cool to drive something new. WELL, the car was completely COVERED in bird feces and the alignment was so messed up the steering wheel was literally as a 45 degree angle to the right. With this being one of the cheaper car rentals, I guess you really do get what you pay for. My advice, if you want something reliable, spend the extra money to rent from a major car rental place. It will be worth it.",3,US,"August 19, 2020"
"Fox rent a car is horrible.Bate and switch, they lure you in with cheap daily rates then clobber you with addons such as $12 a day for toll plate plus tolls  and insurance turns 11.00 a day into $50.00 per day, not at airport",1,US,"August 19, 2020"
The customer service was horrible. They over charged my trip. I verbally declined to take the insurance since I was carrying my own insurance. But I was still charged with the extra insurance amount. Please sign carefully all those small documents which are feed through small credit card swipe machine. They will rush you and make you sign.,1,US,"August 18, 2020"
"2 hours waiting (for Covid related - the note says, umm, really, what part of COVID causes the delay of vehicle rentals?) in a hot space, no AC, then didn't get the car that I reserved several MONTHS ago.. said I would have to upgrade or downgrade.. when I said I would upgrade for the same price I paid since it wasn't my fault, all of a sudden an upgrade wasn't available.. so had to take a downgrade.. and then was told I had to speak to a manager upon the return to ask for the 20% discount.. seriously.. why couldn't she issue that right then and there?  So, I had to wait in ""priority"" line when returning, good thing because the other line was just as long as it was the first time.Car went through car wash prior to receiving but BAD finger smudges on the interior that I couldn't even wipe off with a wet napkin or paper towel.The shuttle from the airport to rental lot felt like it was blowing hot air and seemed they were understaffed as we were the only ones waiting at the airport while other rental companies had several shuttles.. and they filled it up (people) so I guess COVID really wasn't a concern (mind you, it is BS and if people are concerned, they should take better care of themselves or stay home, period, it's media lies and fear tactics for politics)Won't use Fox again.. even if it is 100 cheaper as it is not worth the hassle, NEVER had this issue with any other rental company.. .I should have believed the reviews",2,US,"August 17, 2020"

Car was rented thru priceline and it took almost 1 hour to check out. Had to sign twice because computer system shut down. Was forced to pay for sunpass to cover tolls which cost $12 a day. Staff said there are a lot of toll roads in Florida and they don't accept cash which was a lie. We only went through 2 tolls and they both accepted cash. They scammed us out of $48. There were too many hidden costs. Instead of costing $5 a day which was included in our bundled package thru priceline the rental ended up costing $40 a day. Would not recommend,1,US,"August 09, 2020"
I did not check the gas mileage when I left started driving the car that the contract said was full and on the freeway ran out of gas tell me I wasn't scared to death driving on I 15 salt city I did make it to a gas station on fumes I was by myself and I was scared,1,US,"August 08, 2020"

"The agent who I was assigned to outright lied to try and get me to pay $12 a day for the toll pass (would have cost me an additional $80 or so). Even after I looked up the roads on google and saw that they didn’t have tolls, he told me google was wrong. I thought about talking to management upon my return. But knowing Fox’s reputation and the smoothness with which the agent rattled off the tolls roads, I assume this practice is encouraged by both management and corporate. Another issue, because of flight changes, I had to pick the car up early. I was charged a full day at $72 rather than an additional fee for the few hours. I asked if I could bring the car back early to eliminate the fee for an extra day. The agent told me he couldn’t modify my reservation (which I’m assuming is also untrue). I know these are things I should expect from Fox, with a reputation of bad service and so many 1 star reviews. But even if I’m expecting bad service, it still stings.",1,US,"July 31, 2020"

They are not located at the airport so you have to take a shuttle. The first car brought out wreaked of tobacco. The man that worked there said it was drugs. They asked me if I would like to prepay for gas and they pointed to a sign that said $1.78 and I said yes. However they forgot to tell me to check a box on the contract so they ended up charging me $7.99 per gallon. I had not even used half a tank of gas and it cost me an extre $60.07. When I called and asked why when I thought I had prepaid the Fox employee said I should have more carefully read the agreement.,1,US,"July 25, 2020"
"I rented a Jeep Grand Cherokee and ended up with an old, Hyundai Santa Fe with 30k miles on it and a dented roof.  It actually had sand in the back so, not sure if the car was sanitized or not.  There was no one at the booth at the exit to talk with.  When I returned it, I talked with someone there and they actually do not have Jeep Grand Cherokees to rent.  Hmmmmm.  Then, the woman said I had to buy the unlimited Sun Pass tolls for $15 as she said my EZ Pass would not work.  That was a lie.  EZ Pass works just fine here.  Then, when I returned the car, I wanted to talk to the agent that I rented from.  The only problem is the line was out the door so, I figured I would try to call their Customer Service.  Yesterday, I tried 3 times and each time the wait time is greater than 30 minutes.  Today, I called and it said there were more than 10 callers in the que.  So, I tried to use the chat function on line.  The estimated wait time it said was greater than 84 minutes....So, started off with the bait and switch, got  lied to get another $15 out of me.  And, I have no ability to get in touch with the company without spending at least an hour of my time waiting on hold...In the end, it cost me more than some of the major car rental companies and I got so much less....DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!",1,US,"July 24, 2020"

"BUYER BEWARE, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED I have been renting cars for over 20 years. I have rented from Alamo, Hertz, Enterprise, Avis and the like. FOX A CAR IS THE WORST!  I arrived at the counter to get my car, and $17 a day became $50 a day. Okay, i guess they must have extra cleaning fees and some BS fees, the mans gotta make money yes? Well,,,,,The car i was promised (ford explorer or gmc) was not available to i was given a beat up 2018 Toyota Suv. Out of 9 cars, all the same 2018 Toyota models, were dented, scratched, beat up and filthy inside and out.I was assured during Covid19 that the cars available would be sanitized and properly cleaned...THEY WERE NOT AND I WAS LIED TO. But what now? Do i have time to clean a car that was ordered to be clean of any dirt, stains, stench and greasy handles and dash? I took the what looked like the least dented car and cleanest and drove off to get to work, ie, reason why im traveling during Covid19.NOW...... I needed to extend the rental for another 24 hours due to Covid19 restrictions by the state of Florida to NY. I have been trying to reach Fox Rent A Car for 15 hours, was on hold for over an hour and gave up a few times. I woke up early this morning to get ahold of their customer service and even at 8am EST when they open, i was 9 on the long line. I waited 25 mins, and spoke to Zoey ID# 737. She advised me that i can extend the rental with extra fees and what not. Okay, i get it, the ""Man"" needs to make more money. (fyi, i could return the car, rerent it again for much less, but the travel and time needed to work out weighed that  option). I was then informed that my Chase Credit Card is stopping a new charge from happening and that i will incure another $25 plus the $59.13 already increased extra day rental fee because my card isnt allowing them to charge just the $59.13 fee, SO, HERE IS THE LAUGHABLE PART, THE $25 EXTRA FEE BEING CHARGED BECAUSE MY CREDIT CARD IS ""BLOCKING"" THE NEW $59.13 FEE IT WILL BE TAKEN FROM THE $150 HOLD THEY ALREADY HAVE!!!! This company is NOT here to help its clients, they are here for a quick buck, add on fees and BS customer support.This company Deserves an F- and if i could give it less than 1 star i would.Respectfully,, a 40 year young man who feels sorry for the future to come when ethics are thrown out the window, ignored and rewritten but tiny print and taking advantage of. FYI, PLEASE NOTICE IF YOU GO ONTO THE BBB AND SEE HOW MANY 1 STAR RATINGS FOX RENT A CAR HAS AND YET THEY STILL HAVE AN ""A-"" TOTAL REVIEWS MEANS THEY PAY A SERVICE COMPANY TO MANAGE AND MONITOR REAL REVIEWS IN THE USA WHERE THEY RENT.

In I made a reservation for a SUV at the Oakland location band when I arrived they told me it would be 15 minutes because they were doing a sanitation on it . This was of course a line they tell everyone . Waited 30 minutes to find out they actually ran out of cars . Of course I’m done doing business with a company where I should have know would be bad when reviews are only at 50% satisfaction.

Here you can always quickly rent a good car that meets your requirements. At the same time you can be sure that it will not let you down on the road and you can have a great time with your loved ones. Although I once rented a car here also for business purposes.,5,US,"July 08, 2020"
"Was highly disappointed and frustrated when I could not get the car I reserved and confirmed through Travelocity. I made a reservation for a full-size car six days before my trip. I was to pick up my car by 8:30 AM. I arrived at the Oakland Airport rental office and was told car available. I saw some other renters standing-by and feeling disappointed. The lady clerk told me to  check at other rental companies or wait for at least one hour. I registered and waited. After a long wait, I had to rent from another company because it was getting late for my trip. I have been on my trip for over 4 before I got a phone call from Fox. What a disappointment! I will never rent from or choose Fox Rentals again and would not recommend it to any of my friends. Fox has a very poor business attitude.",1,US,"July 08, 2020"
"Car was great and price of the car was great, but I don't like how they try to upsale you as you're picking up the car. I was talked into purchasing a $10 a day toll pass because the rep said that even one toll would be $20. I will be more prepared next time, but knowing that I was going to be doing a lot of driving, I thought, probably better get it. I spent $80 for the pass and needed it one time. There are 4 or 5 upsale points. Price never comes out to what you were expecting to pay. This is my second or third experience like this with Fox. I would rather have the option when reserving to get all of the extras then just confirm choices at pick up. It would speed things along too. The pick up process takes about 10 minutes per person and when there are 4 clerks and a line of 12 people? You do the math. It's a long time to wait when you've just gotten off a flight and are ready to get to the hotel for the night.",3,US,"July 06, 2020"
"By far the worst car rental experience I have ever had. I waited for 20 minutes for the shuttle at the airport. Then, when we arrived on-site there were 10-12 people ahead of me in line. It took an hour and 10 minutes for me to finally get my car. They also charge a penalty for extending the rental period. When all was said and done it was more expensive and less convenient than the other options out there.",1,US,"July 05, 2020"
"Unbelievable how bad this company is to work with. Yes, it is a non refundable car rental booking, but who knew there would be a pandemic!! All of our other reservations, at Yosemite and other tourist sites, cancelled on us because it is not safe to be vacationing. Fox car rental would not even answer their phones or return emails to be able to talk to them. I sent emails to the addresses they suggested to other customers with no responses. Very Poor Service!!!As a reply to your reply...June 1st is not long enough, how can you think this pandemic is over. Our reservations were for June 6th and everything was still closed and not safe to fly. Why should someone that booked for May 30 get their money back but June 1st just get a credit. Our granddaughter's graduation was still cancelled, as were our AirBnB reservations for Yosemite. Priceline gave us a refund on hotel reservations that were suppose to be nonrefundable, no questions asked. I had sent messages to that email address and to the billing@ address that was posted on other people's reviews with no response. A credit for another trip and having to deal with this company that doesn't answer the phone, call back messages or answer emails....I don't think so!!",1,US,"June 29, 2020"

Arrived at PHX Rental Car facility at 7PM with a reservation (made a month earlier) for a Jeep Wrangler or similar vehicle for our trip up to Grand Canyon.  Got to counter and representative said ""sorry we have no cars left to rent, go try another rental company...nothing we can do for you.""  WOW! What a way to run a business.  A reservation basically means nothing with them; just be fore warned.  Ended up paying about 70% more for a sedan, not a Jeep, from Alamo and we were lucky to get a car.

"We booked our reservation with AARP/expedia for our trip to Phoenix AZ. Our confirmation said “Your Fox reservation is confirmed! No need to reconfirm.” We thought perfect we are all set for a vacation to see our family.  We boarded our plane all was good. We traveled over 8 hours by plane from Buffalo NY. To arrive in Hot Hot Phoenix.  We were so excited to start our vacation.  We get the shuttle and arrive at the Rental Car Center to find the line to Fox Rent A Car all the way out to the main concourse area of the center and only one employee behind the desk. We think well this is going to be at least an hour but, were here and almost on the way to our hotel. With in 15 minutes that dream ended. We were harshly informed that they have no rental cars.  What is the point of a reservation. This is only our second visit to AZ where we rented a car.  So we had no idea the set up.  So we called our son who started to drive out which was 45 minutes away. After about 15 minutes we asked the only employee we saw walking by if our son was able to pick up outside. We quickly found out no. We had to text our son and tell him that we would be there but, he didn’t know where that was and we didn’t either. Our phones were less than 5% as we had been traveling over 8 hours by now.  We had to walk in the 110 degree heat to an empty parking lot, no cover and no one around. A relaxing vacation has turned into hectic confusion and chaotic. Very disappointed in your company. A reservation should be honored. You should not overbook.  Very poor business practice. NEVER Fox again.",1,US,"June 25, 2020"

"Worst car rental company I’ve ever had to deal with by far. I went online this morning and caused some confusion about the policies so I called and had the representative walk me through the steps and I told him that I recently moved to Michigan and because of the lockdown due to COVID- 19, that I do not have a Michigan drivers license I only have my old California address on my license and I told him that I don’t have a major credit card only a debit card he said that was fine as long is I put that information into the system it would be fine because the name still matches and the billing address for the debit card was for Michigan So I did that and I did the pre-paid option since it was cheaper and immediately after that a family member brought it to my attention that they might not accept the drivers license even though we entered in their website that it was a California license so I called back and after being put on hold for 40 minutes once again, the representative that answered told me that “no if you don’t have an out of state license and you only have a local address on your drivers license from the area that you are going to Rent the car from” that they won’t accept it and because I did a pre-paid option that i would lose my money -we’re talking almost $300...So the guy told me to argue with their billing department and so he transferred me and after being on hold for another 1.5 hours, I finally got through to someone even though she argued with me she agreed to refund it however she disconnected the phone call as she claimed she was processing it! no one called me back at all and instead of refunding me they actually charged me they did cancel the reservation but they charged me in full for the price of the vehicle.I cannot get over the poor quality customer service and having being on hold for over two hours and then disconnect and not bothering to call them back I don’t know what kind of system they are using that they cannot see the customers callback information for something like this that is incredibly upsetting since overall I’ve been dealing with this company for three hours today not only do they have a very poor policy in place And poor outlook on what good customer service is. I have rented several cars in my life and I’ve never dealt with something like this. Now I’m going to have to call and be put on hold for another two hours before I can get a hold of someone it’s absolutely insane how they have their system set up and I’m going to have to argue now because obviously the woman didn’t do what she said she was going to do so now I’m gonna have to somehow prove what I was promised which I’m not feeling very optimistic about at this point.",1,US,"June 16, 2020"
"If I could describe what I’ve dealt with thus far with fox in two words, I would say “Terrible experience”. I arrived upon opening time at Fort Lauderdale airport to pick up the vehicle and there were so many technical difficulties. The rep told me that their system was down after swiping my card for payment and I couldn’t get the car until the system came back up. After almost an hour of waiting and the system didn’t come back up, the rep eventually gave me a paper to sign as a contract... why wasn’t that thought of before wasting my hour? Not only that, I was charged an underage fee during this time of COVID-19. All other major car rental companies were waving underage fees until June 30. I booked with fox because I knew they were waiving it but when I got there, I was informed that it is no longer being waived as a of last week because things have gone “back to normal”. After the hour of waiting, I spent an additional 30 minutes to get a vehicle. The first vehicle I got popped up with an “oil change” message on the dash board before I could even put the car in drive. It was a hassle to grab my luggage to go from car to car to find one that was actually working. Before and after getting the rental, I attempted to contact both the local location and the customer service line and couldn’t get in contact with neither. The line said “there are more than 10 callers ahead of you” and after waiting for 30 plus minutes the call automatically ended. I understand that now may be a tough time but it seemed as if no one was trying to help. The airport was empty when I went and phones just weren’t being answered. This experience was like no other honestly. The prices at fox attracted me but after this experience, I’ll probably never book with them again.",1,US,"June 15, 2020"

I rented a car from them in May 2020 from the John Wayne AirPort offsite location.  I did not get the car I had requested online.  The car was scratched and dental all over.

Had a reservation to rent a jeep wrangler at the Phoenix airport upon getting to the rental desk they tried to give me a Hyundai Santa Fe so they had no more jeeps I asked if they ever had any and they said they do but they don’t have license or insurance and this is been a problem for quite some time. I think it’s very misleading to bring people in under the pretext  that you have a jeep wranglers for rent. worst part was having to wait in Aline for one hour. Just to here Can you go rent a Hyundai Santa Fe instead of a jeep wrangler I’ll see how the two are similar in class. I can’t remember ever renting from fox and it turning out well always a line forever,1,US,"May 23, 2020"

"I have only used Fox Rent a Car once, their rates are favorable from the other more mainstream rental company I was using before, thought I would give it a go.  Second time out I paid up front to get the best pricing and then the Corona Virus hit.  I was locked down in Canada and could not go to the Las Vegas where I had my reservation.  I called 10 days prior to my reservation to cancel, I waited for almost 90 minutes to speak with a live person at the Las Vegas center, they told me they couldn't help me and gave me another number....I waited and waited for someone to answer the phone, it never happened, at the end the message said they were unable to answer call right now...I have written three times, I first wrote six weeks ago,  still no response.  Right now they have the rental fee and the deposit and I have not received ANY customer service....I don't consider this company as a good corporate citizen and will be going to Consumer Matters here in Canada to report so that other Canadians can be aware of how this company operates.May 17, 2020I would like to report that I have now received a full refund from Fox Car Rentals, and I believe that is was not due to the review above, it just took the company a long time to process my credit.  So I am happy that they understood that I could not come to the USA and had no choice and did the right thing.

The airport shuttle and actual car rental experience was good, but my credit card was later billed for a bunch of ridiculous hidden fees. I tried to contact customer service, but support was non-existent and their on-hold message is so obnoxious, literally replayed every 30 seconds, that it's obvious they're trying to get you to hang up.",2,GB,"April 28, 2020"
Terrible experience. The car itself was fine but additional charges at pick up and they added charges when I returned the car when I was expecting a deposit back. Phone lines were always busy then eventually when I got my credit card company involved it was too late. NEVER AGAIN. You have been warned.,1,FR,"April 20, 2020"
Very professional company. They delivered as expected. Highly recommended !,5,US,"April 17, 2020"
"I booked a car in February with Fox Rent A Car through carrentals.com. I have booked using carrentals.com many times before, though always with Dollar, National, or one of the larger rental car companies. This was my first time using Fox.Every time I book a car, Fox consistently has the lowest prices around. Now, there's the old adage, ""you get what you pay for,"" which implies that a lower price likely means subpar service, right?Not in this case! Having booked through a third party, there was an issue with my reservation upon arriving at O'Hare airport to pick up the car. The issue was too complex for the agents at the Fox counter to be able to help me out. I reached out to Fox customer service and had a response within a day! Not only were their replies quick, but they made sure to continue to work with me until I was completely satisfied.My experience with Fox's customer service has been one of the best experiences I've had with any customer service department in my life.If you're thinking of booking with Fox, do it. You'll be glad you did.",5,US,"April 14, 2020"
"The wait at the rental counter was unbelievably long, over an hour.  Only had two people working.  This same thing happened the last time I rented from Fox.  I found myself on a cashless toll road by mistake and they charged over $80 for one toll.  Literally highway robbery.  Will not use Fox again.",2,US,"April 06, 2020"
"Chat service wont respond, I call by phone number, no response. Need to get documents for a claim, no response.",1,US,"March 25, 2020"
"Very frustrated with the cancellation process during the Covid19 situation made several attempts to call and cancel the rental, the number was either busy or you were ask to hang on and that they were receiving a high call volume of more than ten and they would get to you when your time came from a voicemail that kept repeating itself. After hanging on for a half an hour I hung up. I called back later and choose the option to leave a call back number and they would address the issue, after waiting  for two hours, I gave up.",3,US,"March 22, 2020"
"Initially we posted a Good review on Fox rental when we rented a car from them 3/1-3/7/20.  My wallet went missing on our return trip from Tampa. We noticed it after going through TSA. TSA contacted us immediately and said it was not found there. We spoke to Fox’s corporate office in California and received confirmation from them that they had emailed the Tampa branch twice to contact us. We could not get them to contact us to let us know if the wallet was left in the car or  even if they has looked in the car. We are considering it a theft by Fox, since they will not contact us. I had to replace all my cards, checkbooks, etc including my social security card. My mother had just died and the inability to talk to them is inexcusable. We will be filing a police report that we feel it is a theft at this time by Fox. We  had put a good review on Facebook which we will change. This all occurred long before the coronavirus caused cancellation and even any interruption of business so we don’t feel there is any excuse on their part. We were told by corporate that other than us flying down to Tampa which is not even possible at this time, there is no direct number to call them which seems ridiculous. What if the car we rented broke down?  How would we contact them. The calls go to California.  Laurie and Andrew Clark. West Chester PA.",1,US,"March 22, 2020"
"If you make any change to rental agreement, Fox will CHARGE THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF YOU! Rented car at Tampa; sign at counter read early return charges waived due to coronavirus. Tried to return car early BUT Fox said they'd still charge the penalty charges/fees. Fox DENIED anything about waiving charges due to the coronavirus.",1,FR,"March 21, 2020"
"I booked a car through carrentals.com with the car agency Fox rent a car for $367.When I pick up the car, I have been told the one way fee was not included in the price.How is that possible?! What's the point to book online if all fees are not included? I had to payed $171 drop fee.Also, they did not inform us that the law requires you to take a liability insurance in this state (California). The broker should have tell us that was mandatory. So I also paid an additional $257 for the insurance.The price of the car rental has doubled!!Also, I booked an SUV. They had about 20 SUVs I was able to choose from. No one at the agency was able to tell me which one had Android auto or Apple Carplay. So I checked by myself : all the cars were the same model, Mitsubishi Outlander, and none of them had Android Auto or Apple Carplay...Update: Fox rent a car accepted to refund me some fees. So I updated my review from 1 star to 3 stars.",3,US,"March 19, 2020"

"Terrible from start to finish. I pre booked a car in December 19 to pick up on February 27th of February. I pre paid for everything before travelling at a cost of $429 with a remaining $136 to pay on pick up.The shuttle from the airport to Semoran Boulevard was great with only a 5 minute wait and 15 minute transfer, bus driver was helpful polite and very welcoming. The troubles started the minute we got of the bus, the guy at the counter took our details and started to process our vehicle and then hit me with a final total of $525 😢 one of the charges was for toll roads and the other for full to empty which I didn’t want as knew the was a fuel stop just up the road and the other was for some sort of insurance that he is sited I would need, after 40 minutes standing and trying to say I did not want any extras I crumbled and just paid the money as my wife and the rest of our party were getting fed up of waiting and getting restless after the long journey, when he handed us the keys they were for a for a Toyota runner, I asked if this was going to being enough for our party and explained that I had booked the Ford Explorer which has 7 seats and room for 4 large cases and he said yeh there are only 4 of you, disgruntled I went out to find the car and was again disappointed as the car was damaged in the outside had the highest mileage on any hire car I have ever seen and the inside was scratched on the dash with work mats on the floor and when we opened the back doors the rubber trims were hanging down on both rear passenger doors.  I know a hire car has been used and expect some wear and tear but this was way above that and although I am not a prima donna I do expect a certain level when paying over the odds for a nice car to treat the family too for a special holiday.  I looked around the car park to see if there were any larger cars resembling the Explorer and couldn’t see one so wonder if they do actually supply this model !,!On a positive the return trip on the shuttle was again exemplary and. Credit to the drivers.",1,US,"March 17, 2020"
"My experience on line was extremely good.  II was a little concerned it might take a while as it was on Monday, usually a busy time; but I couldn't have been on line for more than 5-10 minutes max.  It went very smooth.  I got the car I wanted at a good price and am now ready for my vacation.Thanks",5,CA,"March 16, 2020"
"Worst ever customer service, spent 1hour on  waiting call. At the end I lost the deposit and the rental payment without to be able to get a credit or anything back.Never use again this company",1,CA,"March 13, 2020"
"I enjoyed the quality of the car. However, the agent has a lot to sell us some services that we don’t even need (car insurance, the toll pass for the highway, etc.), and he even went on to say lies (that we have to pay if we want to go to Miami)",4,US,"March 12, 2020"

I used Fox rental at Fort Myers  Airport  (RSW). After over 50 rental car experiences I had the worst experience for renting a car at this location. I went to the pickup area and just missed the shuttle.  It was 20 minutes before the next shttle arrived and it filled quickly and left many people waiting for the next one.  When we arrived at the rental facility there was a line in the office running out the door and down the exterior ramp. It took 1 hour and 45 minutes to get to the counter and another 15 minutes to get my car although I was prepaid and filled out my paperwork.  Well over 2 hours.  I would have gladly paid 100 dollars more to eliminate the wait time.,1,US,"March 10, 2020"
Attempting to rent a car at Sky Harbory Intl Airport in Phoenix. 42 people in line and only 2 employees at counter. Standing in line for 40 minutes already. Terrible customer service. Will NEVER rent from them again and I would recommend it for anyone. Not an isolated occurrence either! NEVER AGAIN,1,CA,"March 08, 2020"
"We had an excellent experience.Our front desk attendant was very friendly and honest about what we needed or didn’t need. Our vehicle was ready when we arrived. They offered us their special to upgrade (at an additional cost), we decided we didn’t need the extra space. No pressure at all. We paid for their toll pass for the 14 days we had the vehicle. Smartest move we made! Every road seemed to have a toll on it. We paid their “we fill” gas rate and didn’t have to fill the tank before returning. It was more of a convenience to us, as we didn’t have to pay the higher priced gas by the airport. Drop off was a breeze (although I missed the turn in lane and had to double back). There are no back entrances, so you have to keep an eye out for this drive way. Overall, we had a great experience. Everyone was very friendly and helpful! We would definitely rent from them again!",5,US,"March 07, 2020"
Easy to use...best prices available...next time I'll go right to Fox instead of spending the afternoon shopping the net.,5,US,"March 06, 2020"
"I've had my trip booked for awhile to Florida. Unfortunately we had to cancel. My recite says it has a return policy, After calling and sending E-mails they are not willing to give me any money back. I canceled 13 days prior to arriving to Florida. They only want to give me a credit that I can use within a years time, but I have no plans to travel within the year. I've even offered to take a fee for the cancelation, And the cost of the rental was $430! I've emailed them again and no one will respond, or even talk to me on the phone. I've asked to talk to a Supervisor and I cant get one. So I guess I'm out of $430, this is a HORRIBLE company to deal with.",1,US,"March 04, 2020"
"Horrible company. We rented & prepaid out of Salt Lake City. The office hours were inaccurate. They had no cars available. Manager was incredibly rude. After we slept on airport waiting for them to open, the had a one car come in, which was subpar to what we rented & prepaid for. As soon as we started questioning, the Manager said she didn’t like us & would not rent to us. Family returning the car complained about how bad the car smelled & how incredibly bad the customer service was. Do yourself a huge favor & don’t even remotely consider renting from them. They lure you in with cheap prices, but you’ll end up “paying” big time, with regrets. Absolutely horrible experience.",1,US,"February 29, 2020"
"I have had unfavorable issues with the shuttle, managers and counter people, but there is one person at Fox that has me coming back, Penny Nordstrom, she is epitome of customer service,.she makes sure she understands all questions and concerns to resolve or help with things like navigating the web site and what charges mean.in sort, great personable customer service and makes sure you leave the conversation with a smile.Kudos Penny and thank you, I look forward to working with you again!!!!",5,US,"February 28, 2020"

Terrible service from start to finish and I was WAY overcharged.  When I picked up the vehicle I told the very snarky agent I would fill the car with car before returning it rather than paying their $9 per gallon rate.  I brought the car back with a full tank but they charged me for a full tank anyway at the $9/gallon rate!  I tried several times to resolve this matter but the company won’t even respond to me.  I will never rent from Fox Rent A Car again!,1,US,"February 27, 2020"

"This is the WORST car rental agency EVER. Car was not equipped with a spare tire. Got a flat.  There was NO SPARE TIRE in the trunk. Called Roadside assistance for help. They told me I had to get transportation to get back to Ft. Myers (over an hour during rush hour) to exchange the car.  They would not drop off new rental to me, NOR would they even have a garage change the tire at their expense. Absolutely the WORST experience I ever had with a merchant. DO NOT RENT FROM THEM.",1,US,"February 24, 2020"

"I do not typically write reviews, but my experience at Fox Rental Car in Salt Lake City was such an awful example of poor company policies and even worse customer service that I feel the need to write this review. I waited about an hour for the shuttle bus to go to the offsite location. Shuttle bus driver did not let most people on, stating guests could not stand on the bus. Had to wait another 20 minutes for the next bus (interestingly that driver said riders could stand). Waited another hour at the location, witnessing customer after customer not get the car they ordered - it is Salt Lake City in the winter and most customers have skis, yet the company overbooks SUVs but then don’t have the vehicles when you arrive. I, however, was not skiing and wanted only a compact car. Upon finally arriving to the desk, I was told my reservation was released because I did not arrive within 3 hours of my rental reservation. Of course, I tried to explain that the majority of that time was spent waiting for shuttle buses or on the line, but to no avail. I then asked to have the representative at the desk make me a new reservation at the desk but he said no. The explanation was that they had no cars to rent. While at the desk I made a new reservation (apparently they do have cars). The customer service was abhorrent- DO NOT EVER USE THIS COMPANY!",1,US,"February 22, 2020"
Used the Salt Lake city Location - looks cheap but don't be fooled - 1st - U have to travel to an offsite that they don't say anything about. Then after dropping off the car somehow I was charged another $150 for a car the was not what I wanted or needed. If you want to complain too bad - their phone services just drops you after a series of changes.,1,N/A,"February 21, 2020"

"We took our car in Miami, the pick up location was off airport, it was not a problem because we've got the info on our voucher. There, we were told that the drop off location in Orlando was in the airport, that ""Miami was the only Fox off site location"". So we made the mistake not to check before dropping off the car, we went to the airport first and we were looking for the Fox drop off location, it was far from the airport, the shuttle to bring us back took a while to come, we barely made it to our flight and we were 2 hours early.",1,US,"February 18, 2020"

"AVOID! I've rented numerous cars in my life and never experienced such a terrible product. Never. My reservation was canceled by them upon my arrival. They charged me twice as much and put me in an old SUV that was in at least 2 wrecks that had shotty repairs so bad my passengers had to yell over the wind noise. It had at least with 91,000 miles on it. When the other reviews say ""OLD CARS"" they mean very tired and old. Safety is my concern. I filed a dispute with American Express - and WON!

The worst experience ever and cost me way more than a reputable company. If you think you are getting a bargain you are sadly mistaken especially if you have prepaid for your rental.

"My wife and I waited over 45 minutes in a line of 6 renters in Austin last week.  It seemed to be an issue of either first time renters who couldn't understand all the add-on's the Fox representative threw at them, or how they would pay for the rental.  One renter wasted 25-30 minutes renting a car.  The rep. should have moved them through the rental process but didn't.  The one star is for the vehicle we finally received.  The car was relatively new, and ran well.What has not happened is when I returned the vehicle, the rep said she would e-mail a copy of the bill to be.  That was 5 days ago, and no e-mail.  However, in the meantime, Fox has charged me $ 54.08 over the confirmation figure they sent me.  Now I am on hold for 32 minutes to speak with a rep.  Who Knows if they will solve the issue.  OK, now 52 minutes later and still waiting for an Live Chat rep, the screen says 2 in a line for the last 34 minutes, and to wait another 16 minutes, RIGHT!Heard back late this afternoon from Fox, who say they can't find my rental agreement, and that I arrived late to their counter, even though we arrived in Austin only 17 minutes late according to FlightAware, and after picking up our luggage, we were in their line about 40 minutes later than the rental confirmation time.  They say we arrived at their counter over THREE HOURS later and lost our car hold.  Beginning to wonder how they remain in business. If they cannot find it today, I will challenge the charge on my credit card so that they can find the agreement!OK, it's been two weeks and after my immediate reply to the individual who said we were THREE HOURS late, not another reply from Fox.  Late last week, I filed a complaint with my credit card company challenging Fox to produce an invoice.  We'll see what Fox's reply will be.",1,US,"February 12, 2020"

"Tiffany has bad customer service and an attitude.  She made me downgrade to a lower vehicle category, after I returned a car that had a nail in the tire when the tire gauge light came on. Not only that, but it looks like they knew about it at the time it was rented out cause there were markings on the tire that were in marsh pen. But only visible if you are to look at the tire within 5 inches of actually inspecting the tire.  And yes I did take photos of the rental I had.Also, systems are slow all the time, others that work there act like it’s the end of their life working there and have such long faces.Some times while standing in line, it takes an average of 30 mins per customer with only 2 people on staff.Plus they also charge you for a full day’s charge if you arrive earlier than your scheduled",1,US,"February 09, 2020"

"Inre: Fox Booking Number WFX036793ABernardo at Fox's Valencia call center was very efficient and professional in helping me clean up the mistakes from the extremely bad service I received from another Fox Rent a car employees I spoke with earlier that same day (Saturday morning Feb. 8). The problem began when I called Fox to find out why my credit card payment for a booking in Las Vegas (which I was attempting to make  online) wouldn't go through.  After about two hours or so, just as the problem was close to getting resolved, the man who was supposed to be helping me hung up the phone, causing me to spend the rest of the day trying to get my payment to go through. In frustration, I called back Fox late in the day and this time got Bernardo, who promptly fixed the problem and credited me back $28, about $25 less than I would have paid if my problem was dealt with professionally and the other guy who was helping me hadn't hung up the phone before my problem could be resolved, which wasted  hours more of my time and (after the adjustment made by Bernardo) cost me about $25 more that I should have ordinarily paid on my $600 booking) it the original Fox rep had done a better job.  As a long time Fox customer, I believe that under these circumstances additional compensation is justified.  I am grateful to Bernardo, but at the same time look forward to hearing from you about my request for an additional adjustment to make up the difference from what I would have paid and also to compensate me for the time that I lost unnecessarily in completing this booking. The difference between an ""A"" (Bernardo) and an ""F"" (the original Fox employee) is Average.  How Fox responds will help me weight whether to give the company a higher rating in the future but also whether to give it my future business.   In the meantime, please add my Fox Rewards number (SFDZ1EE) to my latest booking: (WFX036793A).thank you,Mike S",3,US,"February 09, 2020"

I had to wait for appx 65 minutes and received a car with worse gas mileage than the car I had originally reserved. I was late to my business appointment due to the delay in providing me a car.

Website Defaulted  to another airport pickup and had to call customer service to get corrected. Good luck with that as they were very hard to understand. Because I paid up front they could not issue me a credit so I could resubmit. Gave me billing number and called them I was told (vis robo girl) that there was more than 10 people ahead of me. While on hold (driving from Scottsdale to Tucson) the same robo girl kept telling me I was the 10+  still in line. Finally when I got to my destination I called and got in the que for a call back. Brian in billing was very helpful. Will know more tomorrow when I call to get my credit straighten out. Notified Amex about pending charge. Not happy but again will know more tomorrow,1,US,"February 07, 2020"

My poor wife waited in a line for more than 60 minutes at Sky Harbor, in Phoenix, in the middle of the day, for a scheduled rental.  Customer service rating would be 1/2 star.

Shame on you.........................................",2,US,"February 06, 2020"
"First time renting with Fox. I rented near the Salt Lake City airport. I had reserved a Special SUV, which was noted as a Jeep Wrangler or similar on the website and the confirmation. They did'nt have one when I arrived and offered me a Volkswagon Jetta instead, and at the price of the Special SUV. Small car, same price? In my opinion, a discount should be offered if I'm being given a much lower rental class. Unfortunately, it was late at night and near closing time. I was told this was the best they could do. OK, but in my experience with other rental companies the vehicle will be upgraded or there will be a discount. I felt like the counter person thought he was doing me a favor by providing me a vehicle. Sorry, not likely to return.",2,AW,"February 06, 2020"

"Fox rent-a-car was by far the worst experience I’ve ever had with a rental company. I’ve done quite a bit of traveling in my time and I’ve never been so mislead than with this company. Without some long drawn out review I’ll keep it short. Insurance cost me $545 which is not advertised, and considerably more than other car rental companies. The car they gave us was in terrible condition as well. It smelled, stains, and the engine was having a hard time going through gears ( automatic transmission ) should not do that normally. Renters beware.",1,US,"February 06, 2020"

"Representative was cheater and liar. We have booked a car with description of 7 seat and 2 large bags. We went to florida and during after picking up the car they gave us Toyota SUV. That car dont have space to keep the luggage. I have requested to person that description mentioned space for 2 luggage and there is no space. He was not ready to listen. He tried to get more money from me and said you can get mini var and it will cost additional 100$ per day. This company is total cheater as they give wrong description online and once you do booking with them they are not ready to listen or help. They will just try to get more money from you. Additionally he asked if you take half tank plan then we can refill the half tank with gallon price 2.3$ per gallon. He said outside gas price is 2.8$ per gallon. I visited Florida first time so i dont know about the price. When we went out we found gas price 2.2$ per gallon and when we received final bill they charge us 2.5$ per gallon. Their representative at front desk are cheater, liar and not co-operative. I have asked multiple time that your car description is wrong and we will not fit in this car with 2 kids but he was not ready to listen and top of that he was trying to sell me upgrade car for additional 100$ per day which cost me additional 500$ because I have 5 days booking.

I recently reserved a rental car for a week long trip in vegas. At the time of booking I reserved a chevy camaro convertible. When I arrived at the fox rental today to pick up my car they said they did not have the convertible that I had reserved 2 weeks ago. When the associate tried to get the manager to help make this right he repeatedly wandered off and avoided the situation eventually telling me “the only vehicles they had left was a Chrysler 300c and a jeep wrangler”. I don’t know how either one of them are considered a reasaonable alternative to a convertible camaro. Because I booked it thru priceline they would not refund my money so I could go elsewhere and get the car I wanted. They did absolutely nothing to make this right in the end all they did was say sorry. very poor experience will not be returning.,1,US,"February 02, 2020"

"The car itself was OK, not the cleanest but not too bad.BTW, this experience was at the Ft. Myers airport location.The agent asked me to sign for charges when I picked up the car that were higher than my reservation called for. When I asked about it, she told me it was for the full tank of gas they were providing, though she had not asked me how I wanted to handle gas options. That was slick at best, deceptive if you're cynical. I was only going to drive about 100 miles while I had the car, so I had no incentive to bring a car back over 1/2 full with their ""cheap"" gas. It's pretty hard to take that gas with you on the plane.Also, the car's mileage on my contract was about 200 miles lower than what I saw on the odometer when I got in the car. When I flagged down an employee in the lot, he told me ""Don't worry about it, it's unlimited mileage. They just write some number down."" True enough, but seems a bit sloppy.The shuttle bus driver was extremely upbeat taking us back to the airport after we turned the car in, which left me feeling a little happier,  but I'll think twice about using FOX again, unless their rate is quite a bit lower than the competition, which it might be.",3,US,"January 30, 2020"

On hold for 54 minutes. Why are you charging me the $150 deposit and the full price of the rental car $374 on my credit card. This has never happened to me. Charging me before I rented the car. My trip is not for 2 more weeks.I have never been charged the full price of a rental car until I returned the car. My company had me cancel the rental but Fox did not refund the total amount. On my original reservation it said I would be charged the $150 and that was it. This is unacceptable to me. I'm expecting a full refund or I will need to call American Express to reverse and dispute the charge.Oh by the way I was on hold for 1 hour and 20 minutes only for them to tell me that Billing will call me back. A total of over 2 hours now and still no call back. I have rented from Fox many times and have never experienced this type of treatment.,2,US,"January 28, 2020"

"I was a little disappointed this time when I rented a car out of San Francisco Airport. The rep who did the paperwork talked about the Full Insurance Coverage and I bought one for the two day rental I had. her comment was, it will give you peace of mind when you are fully covered. But, when I took the car that was given to me and started driving out of the airport, I started seeing Service Alert and Low Tire pressure on two wheels and in fact all the four wheels had pressure under 30 psi. How can this give you peace of mind when you see the red lights on the dashboard. They have to take care of the cars before renting them. My previous rental from Salt Lake City to Yellowstone for 7 days was excellent.",3,US,"January 28, 2020"

Can not get a person on the phone. And do NOT prepay because you will NOT be able to talk to anyone to extend the reservation. Stayed on hold for an hour. When I get a call back it wasn’t from the right department so when they tried to transfer me to billing I got disconnected! Had to start the whole process over!

"I am a middle aged family man and have rented from many different car rental companies over the years.  This is by far the worst.  The total price on the Expedia reservation was $200 for 7 days.  The shuttle bus took 30 minutes to pick us up at the airport.  When we got there they said my bill was $550 not including a security deposit.  I tried to fight the charges with a manager to no avail.  The only additional options I asked for were 2 car seats and the toll pass.  No insurance.  And the bill still had a $350 mark up!  Ridiculous!  I was so angry but it was midnight and I had 3 small children with me so going back to the airport would have been too much.  On top of that, after I packed my kids and luggage into the van I discovered that the radio wasn't working.  They switched the van but I still got a beat up base model Dodge Caravan.  Never again.",1,US,"January 25, 2020"

I booked a reservation with this car rental company and went against my better judgement. I wanted to give them benefit of the doubt. Heading to Tampa for a wedding in December I reserved a car from 12/19/19 to 12/22/19 way in advance of my trip. I arrived in Tampa 12:35am and headed straight to Fox Car rental to pickup the vehicle after a  long day and extremely exhausted. When I arrived at the pickup counter ( me and 2 other customers) We was told by one of their rep they were no cars available . That left us without a car we then had hurry up to Alamo ( THANK GOD FOR ALAMO) to try and get a reservation the transaction with Almo went smoothly we were able to get vehicle and on our merry way . I would never ever book with Fox car rental again (PERIOD). WORST experience EVER!!,1,CA,"January 25, 2020"

"My wife and I took the car for a 4-day short vacation at Arizona Airport. They stood in line for 40 minutes. Then we could not find a car for 50 minutes. Although we had a car reservation. In the end, around midnight, they gave us a car. The man who gave me the car keys was rude. I asked him why the front bumper is broken? He raised his voice and said that it doesn’t matter. We left the airport and after 30 minutes we heard a strange sound under the front bumper. He was getting louder and louder. I called road assistance but no one answered. I left an audio message and asked me to call back. It was 00:30 AM. We stopped at the nearest gas station to see the reason. I saw under the front bumper that some part is hanging on the wires and dragging along the asphalt. I asked for paper clips and tied this part to the bumper of the car. We had to drive another 2 hours. I don’t know what kind of wires these are and what happened to the car. (I attach the photo) I don’t know what my wife would do if she was alone and took such a car after an accident. When we returned the car after 4 days at the airport, I told the manager Jan everything and showed a photo of how it was. He said sorry and that’s all. I asked if he would like to make us compensation? He said that Fox does not do such a service. Then he asked to describe everything and leave it to him. I wrote my complaint and left him. Frankly, there was an unpleasant impression of such a service. Most likely I will not want to use the services of the Fox company anymore. I do not want to recommend this company to my friends.",1,US,"January 24, 2020"

"Already regretting my decision to rent from Fox. This is my first and last time and I haven't even gotten the car yet. I noticed I was charged a $150 deposit fee along with the total amount of my reservation and asked that the deposit fee be returned. The online chat person said the deposit would remain to ensure the car was returned in the same condition it was given to me. I understand a full tank of gas and not trashed but she refused to elaborate if a car wash/vacuum is required and just kept saying CLEAN and IN THE SAME CONDITION IT WAS GIVEN TO YOU. Obviously this is a racket to keep the additional $150. The company has the credit card on file and all other rental car companies charge that card if the tank isn't full. My rental isn't for 2 weeks so I'll update when I actually get the vehicle, which I see from other reviews is NOT guaranteed to be the same car/class as rented. Needless to say I'm sure it's going to be the worst rental experience I've ever had and I should have paid the extra money to use a reputable company (Dollar, Enterprise, etc.).

"Fox seem to have the best rental prices which is unfortunate since it seems they can easily take advantage of the customer.  I reserved a Jeep at a set price and of course they didn't have it on the lot.

"I rent a car (Hyundai Santa Fe) at Foxrentacar of Miami airport from 17 Dec to 9 jan. Paid in advance $1513 ! You may wonder why so much !? I preferred to pay all the additional insurance coverages, plus the Platepass, to enjoy thoughtless my holidays and to avoid finding surprise charges on my credit card at the delivery of the car. But it wasn't enough ! I received a notice charge for an amount of $78,23 of rental car toll charge. Here is only $3.23 toll charges and $75 administrative fees ! Crazy ! I had previously already paid the PlatePass for the period December 17 until January 9. It's not the first time I've had problems with this rental. Unfortunately I had to choose it again just because I had a credit store to spend. Employees from the Miami office, on the day of my arrival, were having trouble viewing the contract on the computer(you are warned: here the problems happen very often!).  For this, they had to make a temporary new agreement only for one day, until the problem was resolved the next day. I had to come back the next day, driving many miles. Evidently they forgot to apply the platepass for that day. This is definitely not my problem.I do not find a good reason to choose FoxRentacar of Miami : It is not convenient, the pickup point is much more distant than all the other rentals, every time there are problems and surprises on the bill. Stay away !----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update !FoxRentacar suggested I write to the billing customer assistance to assist me. I did it, I gave the charge request number but they didn't even bother to read it. They wrote to me that it might be some charge of some road not covered by Platepass. But this is not the case, this is the list of charges :SR112 EAST(32nd ave)-$0.66I95 NW 144TH ST EXPR -$0.75SR112 WEST (17TH AVE)-$0.66SR112 EAST (17TH AVE)-$0.66I-95 MIAMIGARDENS EXPR-$0.5Total Toll Charges $3.23Total Administrative Fees $75Total Amount Due $78.23This is ridiculous !Everything works badly here, including billing customer service! Think about it for a moment: I came from Italy to Miami to spend a happy holiday. I paid more than 1500 bucks to get a ""cheap"" car for 22 days. I arrived tired after so many hours of flying with three children at the pick-up point. The car wasn't ready because of people uncapable do their job. I had to come back the next day to solve this problem. I came home to Italy and I still have problems ! Don't do like me, choose another Rentalcar, it can never be worse !",1,CA,"January 20, 2020"
"I made a car reservation, they changed the time for pick up and drop off, the price and refused to refund my money. I waited 2.5 hours to speak to a person and they hung up on me. They provided me with their business accounting number which was not a valid number. Worst experience of my life with a customer service. Very, very awful experience.",1,US,"January 20, 2020"

"Fox rental has cheap rates online and on the app, but charges a $500 deposit online when you pay now, versus $150 deposit when you pay later. This is unfair and not ethical nor great business practices. The charge to pay later is also $1,07 more for my rental. So this forces me to go through paperwork in person instead of online.",3,US,"January 20, 2020"

"I've had a number of bad experiences with Fox over the years, but I still use them when they are the cheapest.  They don't maintain their cars.  They wait for it to breakdown before they do routine maintenance on it!  I had one car stop running because the air filter was completely clogged.  When you have the choice of vehicles, check the tires and the number of miles on the car.  Try not to take one with over 40,000 miles on it.  I've also had terrible wait times at LAX to check in and get a car - a couple of times over an hour!",2,US,"January 19, 2020"

"the only admirable thing was the frequency of shuttles at LAX but it took me 45 minutes to get my car, counter line was very very long, they asked me which insurance I wanted to pay for and I declined or so I thought, but I was still charged for plus another fee, ended up paying an additional $50 over my quoted amount, totally not worth it, shady business, better off paying the extra 20 bucks at budget or enterprise",1,US,"January 17, 2020"
"When I called to confirm that I would get a 4 door Jeep, the man just kept saying I might get something else, it just depends on availability.  I don't know what other type of SUV would possibly be listed as a special SUV.  The picture shows a 4 door Jeep and that is my only reason for going with Fox. Otherwise I would have used another company. The guy just kept saying that I might not get the listed vehicle.  This makes no sense to me, as if I am paying for it, I should get it.  Don't rent out more vehicles than you have and there won't be a problem.  If I pay now, it should lock in my rate and my vehicle.  Hopefully when I get my rental it is what I wanted, not whatever vehicle they have left on the lot.",2,US,"January 17, 2020"

"I wish I could leave zero stars- I would. The recording says it is their mission to provide excellent customer service and friendly associates and the actual experience is exactly the opposite. They are rude and automated with every answer not being a real answer but a canned reply ""I am sorry but that is our policy."" I booked a car and when I tried to extend my reservation they penalized me for prepaying!! What kind of sense does that make? Someone wants to give you MORE money and you PENALIZE them for it?? They said I had to change the reservation at the counter and it would be a higher rate PLUS a $20/day ""Change fee""...all I wanted to do was pay the same rate for 4 more days...what a joke...if I had hit the ""pay later"" button (what kinds of business WANTS people to wait to pay them??) I would have no problem,  but bc I paid up front and saved a whopping $2...it locked me into this hell hole they are calling ""excellent customer service"" I will NEVER rent from here again and I am even forfieting this one day rental and not even picking it up. I don't even want to ruin my day by even speaking with someone from their company when I fly into my first day of vacation.",1,CA,"January 16, 2020"

"Be careful when creating your ""Fox Rewards"" profile, folks.  I used the short form of my first name (Doug) when creating the account, then found that Fox automatically applies this name as the name on the credit card when reserving a car, and won't let you change it online, either in your Rewards profile, or when making a reservation.  This results in the online reservation system rejecting the reservation due to faulty credit card info.  I had to e-mail ""rewards (at) foxrentacar.com"" to have them change the name on the Rewards account, which took an extra day and a half before I could successfully make my reservation.",2,US,"January 15, 2020"

Booked the first time - charges to account came through on a 'hold' basis - still took money from my account - without a confirmation.  Was told to book as 'pay later' which is $20 more due to their malfunction on their site.  I still did end up using them for car rental.  Only due to last minute booking - in the future would probably not use them again.,1,US,"January 15, 2020"

"Car I reserved was not available, they gave me a similar suv that was in very bad condition.  the check out staff were to busy to do anything to assist us.  They requested that I call their customer service line and when I did so, their call wait time was too long and they hung up on me several times.  When I did finally get in the call wait queue, they said they would call me back and never did.  Absolute horrible customer server.  We found puke in between the passenger seat and when we told them when we returned the car they said they would give us credit for our next rental.  Well that credit hasn't been emailed to us nor has the receipt.  Good thing I requested a printed receipt.  I will never rent from FOX again.",1,N/A,"January 14, 2020"
Very easy to use...excellent..and always great rates and deals!,5,US,"January 14, 2020"
"***EDIT***  Since I can't reply to the company's reply - that wasn't something that was disclosed to us by Travelocity.  Additionally, had that little bit of information been shared while he was standing at the counter, he would have used his American Express (credit card, not a debit card) at the time of rental instead of canceling his reservation altogether.  I wish I could give zero stars.  My husband went down to San Diego for a business trip in which he needed an SUV for equipment.  We booked on Travelocity with Fox Rent A Car for a decent price.  Only, when he got there, they surprised him with a ONE HUNDRED PERCENT deposit fee!  So on top of the $400 for the rental and $200 in taxes and fees, they wanted another $400 deposit!  When my husband asked them why so high, he was told by the guy at the counter that other companies charge higher deposits.  Not necessarily true.  We travel often and get rental cars everywhere we go.  The most we've been charged is 20%.  I highly recommend that you don't go with Fox Rent A Car if you don't have to.  PLEASE do yourself a favor and go with literally ANYONE else.  Save yourself the hassle of getting to your destination only to be shocked at the ridiculous deposit they charge their customers, completely out of standard with the rest of the industry!",1,US,"January 14, 2020"
"Pretty straight forward and to the point. I would like for the Policy and other fine print to be easily accessible rather than a Blue hyper link towards the page. With everything moving towards simplicity, it was rather difficult to open a 4x4 inch box to read pages of information and to find what I needed. It's a hassle.",4,CA,"January 14, 2020"

"The price was very reasonable.  The car with 68,000+ miles was in need of repair. Quite often the transmission would not shift out of Low. The brakes were catching and probably need to be replaced. The agent at the counter, tried to hard sell the insurance which I did not need.",1,US,"January 14, 2020"
The service is always great and the check in and out is easy and quick,5,CA,"January 14, 2020"
"I have rented with Fox several times. The first few were just fine and I was happy to use them again despite their somewhat low reviews on several platforms. This last time the counter staff was wonderful, helpful, and quick! Once I was at my car I marked a couple of blemishes on the vehicle, including the top trip popping up. As I was driving the vehicle I noticed that the inside of the drivers door had some terrible streaking down the whole thing, like someone sprayed it with something and just let it sit there and dry. Didn't impact the drive. But then later as I was getting out of the car I noticed the trim below the door was also pulling away from the car. While I was driving the vehicle something started rolling around by my feet. when I stopped I looked under the seat and found an insulin injection pen. Thank goodness I didn't have kids that could've picked it up! I placed the pen in the cup holder and notified the staff member when I turned the vehicle in. I don't know how to properly dispose of them. I also had the front passenger window roll down on its own while I was driving. When I went to put it back up the button the drivers side was broken. So I had to pull over and lean into the passengers seat to put the window up. Again, I have had 2 or 3 prior rental experiences that were good with this company. I clearly got a vehicle with a lot of issues this time. It was disappointing.",3,US,"January 13, 2020"

"Fox online and Fox via telephone dont communicate with each other.  When there are online issues you cannot cross reference with a person over the phone.  Also, security deposit should be taken at time of actual pickup and not rental time.  There is no need to bog up someone's credit for a refundable credit that is a moot point if the rental is not even completed.  Also, pay now should be available via telephone, especially when there are issues with completing reservations online.

"I rented a car recently from your Denver location on January 2, 2020 around noon. I wanted to share my experience with and hopefully shed some light why I will never engage in business with your company again and will ensure to pass along my experience with others. My mother was with me and is an avid traveler and rents cars frequently. She also was appalled at the level of service and will never give you her business and intends to pass it along to the many people she travels with. During this first encounter, I would love to give the name of the female employee who helped me but she wasn’t wearing a name badge and failed to introduce herself. I can appreciate how long the process takes to check out rental cars as I have gone through the process countless times. This was by far the rudest and most unpleasant experience I have had. The lady failed to introduce herself and the only time she made eye contact was when she was giving me attitude and then would roll her eyes. I had requested a 4x4 and she walked off to check if any were available. While she was gone, I checked with the people I was visiting via text and they informed me a 4x4 wouldn’t be necessary because there wasn’t an issue with snow while I was visiting. Once the employee came back, I told her I wouldn’t be needing the 4x4 and the 2x2 would suffice. She cocked her head to the side looked at me and said, “You should have told me that before I walked over there to check,” and thee rolled her eyes. The rest of the encounter was short and curt and everything she said was dripping with attitude. After wee were finished, there was no “thank you, have a nice day,” nothing. She tossed the keys at me and turned her back to me. When we returned the car on January 7th, around 5 p.m., I wanted to make it a point to ask an employee what this persons name was. To my surprise, the employee I approached was her. I told her, “Perfect, just who I wanted to see. What is your name?” She replied, “Why do you need my name?” I said, “Because you aren’t wearing a name tag and I want to know your name.” She said, “What for?” I said, “Are you seriously not going to give me your name?” She said, “What do you need my name for?” I said, “This is unbelievable that you won’t tell me what your name is. I want to let the company know what type of service I received from you. What is your name?” She said her name was Tigist. I asked her to spell it for me because it was not a common name. She said, “Why do you need my name?” She then asked for a male employee who was a few computers down who was named Jason/Justin to come over and talk to me. I told her this was beyond unprofessional and unbelievable that she wouldn’t give me her name so I can spell it. She started typing on the computer and then looked at the invoice I had and pointed to the spelling of the name on the receipt. I told her perfect and she should perhaps find employment with a different company because she had horrible customer service skills. She then rolled her eyes at me and I left. The acronym for FOX is not fitting for what this company delivers. I laughed when I saw what FOX stood for. I am not the only one.

This is so easy to reserve a car I love fox rent a car plus I love that they let you use a debit card they are a smart car rental company more people have a debit card than a reg credit card so that will make more people come and rent cars from them so ThankYou for all the car rentals that your company can do for me and anyone eles that needs a car you have a customer for Life thanks,5,US,"January 12, 2020"
I had a great price and 10 min later i came back to book and the price went up $10. Very disappointing.,3,US,"January 12, 2020"
Terrible policy on changing reservations for the pay now option. I wanted to ADD a day and they would not do it! I had to book an extra day with all the fees instead of just adding a day to my reservation. Shaking my head!  I do not recommend this company.,1,US,"January 12, 2020"

Another time I rented from the Ontario airport area and my gps would not get me to the drop off location. I was going to miss my flight from driving around so long.

This place is a rip off!!!!  We rented a car and unfortunately got a flat tire in our way. The car didn't have a replace flat so they send us a new vehicle. The tow truck driver inspect the car and I inspect the new car  which by the way was smaller. Then 2 month later they are calling trying to say we broke the windshield on the vehicle that was in perfect condition when the tower truck took the vehicle. I ask for proof and they said we don't take photos but we took photos of the vehicle when it left our possession. They said doen't matter we are liable until the vehicle is at the lot so what we are suppose to do travel with the tow truck. BEWARE!,1,US,"January 08, 2020"

"I won't rent from Fox again.  1) It took over an hour to get my car in Orlando, even though there were only 3 people on line in front of me. 2) The rental agreement, which you have to sign electronically before you can see it, included a charge of $53/day if the car is returned early-- for a car that only cost $25/day! 3) When returning, I filled up at a gas station across the street from the company, and they still charged by $55 ""refueling"" fee.",1,US,"January 08, 2020"

"They are great at prices, that's for sure! But FOX has a lot to improve on the customer experience side. Their lines usually take 30-60 minutes to pick up a car, even if all is pre-booked. Also, I tried to contact them via the chat on their website and it asked me to leave a message - it's been over 2 weeks and no one ever replied to my request (it was about a past credit). It's kind of fair, you get what you pay for, but still, I wish they aimed a bit higher in building solid customer relationships.",3,CA,"January 08, 2020"
Super easy to reserve and the best prices by far,5,US,"January 08, 2020"
"Not worth the time & aggravation, pay extra for another company!!! We waited for over an hour for the representative to let us know that even though we had a reservation for over a month, they did not have a car for us.  Then at the last minute, someone returned a car and Fox said we could take that one ""as is"".  They said they didn't have time to clean it.  At this point we didn't really have a choice.  We got out to the car & it was on empty (the least of our problems).  Whoever had it before us was very disgusting!  We filled up a whole bag of trash (including bloody tissues in the driver side door).  Thankfully we took video and pictures of everything.  We tried to get several different workers to come inspect the car so we would not be charged for any damage, but they all said they were to busy! When we returned the car we told them that we did not fill up the tank because it was empty when we got it and they said that was no problem.  However, they ended up charging us to fill it up & we did not get out full deposit back.  I had to call customer service & email them the pictures.  I should not have to waist my time to do this when I get back from vacation, as I am busy catching up on work & such! Horrible experience & I will NEVER use Fox Rent A Car EVER AGAIN!!!!  It is yet to be seen if they will refund us the proper amount when they receive my pictures & email!",1,US,"January 08, 2020"

"The website needs some serious upgrading. My DL doesn’t expire until after 2040, however the furthest out the site would let me enter was Jan 2040. So not only is my fee $3 more because I have to select the “pay later” option, my rental rate went up by almost $2 due to trying to work around the system and talking with a representative on the phone who could not help me nor take a reservation over the phone and honoring the original price.

"We rented a car in Las Vegas on Dec 26 and from the beginning it was a bad experience.  When I got to the desk I greeted the agent and said how are you and she said 'I've been better'.  After that it was all downhill.  We were almost forced to buy insurance from the agent until the end when she gave up as they get a commission...The car we received was not a luxury car we asked for and her explanation was 'that is all we have'.  When I got in the car it smelled of cigarette smoke and I have two small children...again, she said that is all we have.  We drove the car for 9 days which went fine other than the car having really poor shocks and would bottom out on every larger bump in the road.  When we arrived at SFO Airport the agent said that the rear exhaust had been hit and asked me where I had an accident...I said I did not have an accident other than the car bottoming out on every bounce.  She neglected to listen and made me fill out an accident form which I just wrote on it 'we did not have an accident'.  Overall we saved a lot of money but it was not worth the headache, anxiety and poor quality of car and service.  Rent at your own risk as they will look to find an issue with your rental",1,US,"January 06, 2020"

"I had a rental reserved with enterprise which I cancelled because it was so expensive.  i reserved a jeep to go into the mountains.  When I went to pick it up, the jeep did not have 4 wheel drive so I had to switch vehicles. The jeep was rented for $75/day and was prepaid.  The bill with taxes was $527. The girl told me the car would be $60 dollars a day, I had already prepaid the previous amount so I tried to ask her if it was going to cost me any extra and she said it would automatically charge to my card. She did not explain that the $60 a day was in addition to the $75 I had already prepaid.  As I signed the bill, I didn't know if the other charge had been reversed, she didn't explain things well at all.  The  rental ended up costing me over $919 for a 5 day rental which was $135 a day plus taxes for a total of $183 a day. And yes this was the final amount after the security deposit of $150 was reversed.  The 4 wheel drive vehicle that I had reserved at enterprise was cheaper and I should have stayed with it.Follow up.  I tried that before this posting.  They were going to call back, they never did.",1,CA,"January 05, 2020"

"I have traveled for business for 30 years and this was my worst experience at pickup ever.   Granted, there was a bowl game the same day as My pick-up, but that does not excuse four  bad things:1.   The line for Car pick up was 2 hours and 15 minutes with hundreds of people in line.2.    The minivan I had prepaid for was not available and I had to wait an additional 30 minutes for a van to be located.3.    The employer lied that a mid-size suv was the same as a mini-van and I had to accept the SUV instead of a mini van (my prepaid rental was for a mini van.. that’s it)4.    The mini van had 65,000 miles and the transmission failed on day 2.   (To their credit, they drove out a different mini van with only 45,000 miles lol to my location for an easy exchange).   Bottom line, the money saving instead of a  different agency, like Enterprise that had no line and Kiosks to check in, would have been worth the extra money.",1,US,"January 04, 2020"

"I tried to book online with a discount code and using the “pay now” option, but the transaction wouldn’t go through. I called customer service, sat on hold for 20 minutes, and then when I finally got someone on the line, he very matter-of-fairly told me that their website “isn’t compatible with the safari browser” and that “you can’t use a discount code with the pay now option.” He said this as if I should’ve somehow known that. So I hung up, and made my reservation with the “pay later” option.  I can’t understand why you wouldn’t want people paying for their reservation now, but apparently that’s their policy. So all that waste of time to not have to pay anything until I arrive. The website should be more clear.",2,US,"January 04, 2020"
"Fox offers discounted rates, which is why we rent from them, but we always run into an issue at the Salt Lake City location.  The owner can be rude and the cars are not usually very clean.

Absolutely terrible experience at SLC.  I booked through an airline website and was excited that I received a good price and nice car.  I took the shuttle to the office - about a 10 minute ride.  This is where the terrible service started.  We were about the 4th group in line.  It took nearly 30 minutes to get to the counter.  I gave my license and credit card and the representative staid that they could not rent me a car because I already had a car out from the other side of the country.  She looks at the other reservation and tells me that it matches my driver's license number but that the name is different.  Sounds to me like a data entry problem on the other reservation and should be easy to clear up.  She tells me that I cannot have 2 reservations.  I agree and tell her that my name and is only on the current reservation. She says to luck.  I ask her to see if she can clear up the wrong number - she says no and gives me the 800 number.  I call about 3 times and wait for over 30 minutes each time.  Per the prompt I leave my number so I can get a call back - it never came.  I was not charged for either car - because I did not rent on that day.  We took the shuttle back to the airport and rented a car from Enterprise - not as good of a price but they provided great service.  I will NEVER rent a car from FOX again.  Avoid this company and their very poor service - doesn't matter the price they quote.  Just try and resolve a problem - it won't happen.  Even sent a message through their website - with no response.  TERRIBLE.,1,US,"January 03, 2020"

I called three times the customer service and no one answered me, so I called Expedia Customer Service and they told that Fox sent my check around Nov 8th so how it is possible that around the USA mails are so slow?!

"I rented a car from Fox in Fort Lauderdale just close to the international airport location (now moved to the airport rental car center). First of all while check-in at the desk I met their representative Nasef who was not friendly at all and his behavior show he hate to work with a customer and I was for him like an annoying fly which he wants to get rid of as soon as possible. Despite my full payment and reservation of SUV vehicle he gave me a small car like Toyota Corolla, even not say sorry or explain they have no SUV available right now. In short, he served me as an enemy. On the parking lot one kind mexicain man show me about 20 small cars to chose, I spent at least 20 minutes to find a car which was less bad than all other cars. All their cars have from 17000 to 80000  of millage, I got a car with 17500 miles but outside and inside this car was like 120000 millage of use. And that was the best of all cars!To be honest, I have to say that there was no problem while check-out the car, everything was promptly and polite on their part.Now I say to all people to avoid this car rental company and I will never book Fox car rental again!",1,US,"January 01, 2020"

"Too many questions are require (*) a response in order to make a reservation. Having made a reservation with a fox earlier today, I found it refreshing not to be forced to answer all these questions upfront.  Additionally, making a phone reservation doesn't require an agreement involving resolution of disputes.  Being involved in the legal realm, I find it problematic to force such compliance when simply making a reservation.  I'd rather provide additional information and agree to such terms when signing an the contract at the rental car facility.  Thank you.",2,US,"December 31, 2019"

The staff is friendly and helpful. I have been to other rental agencies and have not yet found anything that has compared to them. There are no issues or concerns to complain about. if i had a million stars to give them i would give it to them. I recommend this rental agency to all that see this post.

On check out they do not give you a final bill just show a celular phone where your email address is shown saying that I was going to get it via email, needless to say I didn’t get it and I am still waiting for my $150,00 deposit to be credited back to my credit card.

SUV was not even close to the one I reserved online. I had to pay $120 more at the counter, so it ended up  costing more than in most rental places. Very disappointed!!!

"I chose to rent from Fox in San Antonio because they advertised a lower price than other companies. I only needed the car for one night- picking it up at 6PM and returning around 6AM, and it was just me, so I went with the economy option, and did not have high expectations at all. Yet somehow I was still disappointed. The maintenance symbol was illuminated on the dashboard - which the employee quickly dismissed as ""oh, it just needs an oil change"" -but the grumbling from the engine made me wonder how long it has needed that oil change. The worst part was that after I returned the car and looked at the receipt, I saw that I was charged more than my initial quote. Apparently, they set my return time as 6AM - and if you are later than that, you incur additional fees - even though I still had it less than 24 hrs. I have tried contacting the company about this but they have not responded. In summary, they get a poor rating for the condition and safety of the cars, a poor rating for deceptive pricing, and a poor rating for customer service. Other rental companies would have been cheaper and a better experience.",1,US,"December 29, 2019"

Told clerk I need 6 passenger car next day to accommodate my kids and grandkids. Called customer service over three times. Manager supposed to call and update me. He never called. Fox expects me to drive 6 people (4 children) in 5 passenger car. This is illegal and endangers my children. I will not do it. I will rent additional car from another rental company. I expect FOX to reimburse me. Horrible rental company and customer service!! Don’t honor rental contracts. I will never use them again!!,1,US,"December 27, 2019"

I did the latter and was able to get a reservation confirmation number, but I am not sure how this will unfold when I pick up the car, especially if I would be asked to pay again, and not have the offered discount of $33 USD.I appreciate your help on how this can can be cleared.

It took me over an hour to reserve a car. The website kept telling me that my name was not correct even though I know my own name as it is listed on my drivers license and credit card.

"Absolutely disgusted with the customer service!  Our airline changed our flights times, and we are now scheduled to arrive a few hours before our original arrival time.  After waiting 2 1/2 hours on hold to speak with someone in customer service. I requested to move our pick up time 2 hours earlier than originally booked.  A very rude customer service agent said theres nothing he can do and I can't move it up because I paid in advance for our rental car. He said the only way I can change my pickup time 2 hours earlier is to cancel my entire reservation, lose all the money I paid (over $400) and then rebook.  I could understand not being able to change the days or type of car you booked, but this is ridiculous.  Please tell me how this company is even still in business????? So disgusted at the rude man I spoke to and the awful customer service this company provides.  I really hope anybody considering to rent a car from this company reconsiders.  DO NOT RENT FROM FOX RENT A CAR!!!!",1,US,"December 18, 2019"

"The rental experience itself was fine. My problem came after. Fox is incorrectly charging me for parking tickets I already paid with the city of San Diego MONTHS ago. They don't answer the phone, they don't reply to emails, and they DO NOT HELP. I've even resorted to FB message at this point. Complete radio silence.I'm jumping through hoops to get this figured out with my credit card company and all I need to resolve the issue is to hear back from Fox. BEWARE. I've been in customer service for years and would never treat a customer the way I've been treated.",1,US,"December 17, 2019"

He was very rude about the insurance and kept pushing it on us and when we refused to get it he was rude. The lady that handed the keys to us was rude.

after talking to a few sales agents and a billing representative I felt they did not have best customer service. I felt they were a little snippy/rude. Also even though they did extend a credit when usually its nonrefundable to only be able to use the credit towards a pay now option is disappointing. Also the credit could only be used towards another reservation under my name. We don't normally travel a lot so who knows when we can use the credit?,2,US,"December 13, 2019"

Got to Burbank airport to find that not only was my rental car not paid for in my package at Fox, that I was sure I paid for. But that the women at the counter was not concerned or interested in helping us figure it out. Also they said I had to pay for the rental car which would have been fine. However we needed the card we had originally used.I live in MI and did not bring it. There was no documentation that said I could ONLY use that card. Also the women at the counter left us sitting there and left to go to another part of the airport. This was so incredibly rude and disappointing. I will never use Fox again.",1,US,"December 11, 2019"

Correct vehicle for them,and they still needed to be readied.By the time we got our vehicle ,an hour and 15 minutes later... the lady behind the counter was very rude and impatient with previous customers,very unprofessional.By now,I just wanted to get out of there.Our vehicle was not washed at all,and had many nasty stains inside and no windshield washer fluid.In all,I would never want to rent from Fox again,poor service:(",1,US,"December 10, 2019"

This is the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with. I flew into Fort Myers Florida last week. Upon arrival to this trailer I go inside and there is at least 12 people in line with two agents. We waited at least an hour in line. They are a VERY deceitful company. First off they charge you $1000 deposit. Really? $1000!!!  The car we got was filthy inside and out with deep scratches on the car. The restroom was gross and it felt like I was going to fall thru the holes they had in the floor.   The woman at the counter was a grump.  She tried to charge me $13.95 per day as a secondary driver on my HUSBANDS reservation. She told us that to extend our car rental it would be $25 a day. So now I have to rent this an additional two days and that $25 a day in actuality was $75 a day. $135.00 for two more days. She seem to of “forgot“ to mention there is an additional $40 fee.  Needless to say I will stick with the professionals- Hertz and Budget.,1,US,"December 09, 2019"

"I've been a 'member' of Fox Rent a Car's rewards program for years and haven't had a problem with making a reservation on their website up until the past year. I log in, make a reservation and when I go to the 'pay now' option to receive a discount, I can't pay. I repeatedly receive a notification saying ""you've exceeded the number of tries with your credit card'' after the first attempt. I've tried to contact the 'help desk' multiple times with no reply or when I do reach someone their solution is to 'log out and log back in', which has never worked once. The site is flawed. I've tired to change the credit card I have on file as a possible solution, but there is nowhere to change it on the site. This is extremely frustrating as I travel a lot for business and try to rent cars from Fox frequently. Fox, please, update your site to work as it should!",2,US,"December 09, 2019"
