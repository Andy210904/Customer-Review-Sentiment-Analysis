We are advised at this time the car was rented out 5 days earlier and is not due back until 1:00 pm. When I called, I spoke to a manager that was totally incompetent.

"An employee for us traveled to Tampa. First mistake was using Expedia. In no obvious place did it tell you the renter has to have a credit card and not a debit card in his name before renting. He does carry a company debit card in his name. Nothing during the rental process stated this. We try to never travel with credit cards or any cards we do not need. Fox would not rent him the car paid for in advance. They had a sign that specifically read, ""if thius happens request your refund from the third party used to secure the rental. That would be Expedia. Once he was left 1000 miles from home with no transportation he went to Next car rental and within 10 minutes had a vehicle. Be aware of the scams Expedia and Fox car rental run. Look around the internet. They do this to unsuspecting travelers everyday all over the country, then keep their money.

"I reserved a luxury car. They jerked me around for an hour saying it was delayed, then needed cleaned, when I bitched about the wait, they offered me an upgrade for $65 a day for 41 days. When I said No, they offered me a choice of 2 cars in a lower rate class that they said were ready to roll (no refund for the lower rated vehicle). 25 minutes after I agreed, they said the delay was due to it needing to be cleaned. Since I had to wait I told them Id take the original car I reserved, then they told me they didnt have one. Lied to me from the beginning attempting to get me to pay more for the rental. Their extra charges, not disclosed ar time of reservation are excessive.  I declined everything BUT the agent put them on the bill. I MADE him remove them and then I started being ignored. I asked for a supervisor and the agent gave me the name of a vehicle intake guy, not a supervisor. When I got to the real manager, she was awesome, she dealt with me being outraged and offered me a small discount. I ended up with a lesser vehicle with a sports seat that isn't any good for a guy w 4 lower back surgeries and lots of metal. I had to roll out of this piece of garbage and Im expected to keep it for the whole 6 week rental. This is not over.I will never ever trust this company again regardless of the rates.I spent nearly 2 hours at the office with poor results.

"Avoid Fox Car in Morocco – Hidden Fees & Terrible Service!I had an awful experience renting a car from Fox Rent a Car in Marrakesh Airport, Morocco. They charged me €25 for an AdBlue tank that was completely empty after just one day of rental! This is a clear scam – they either gave me a car with an almost empty AdBlue tank or deliberately set it up so I’d be forced to refill it myself.When I reached out to them about the issue, their customer service was useless – completely dismissive and unwilling to help. Instead of admitting their mistake, they just brushed me off and refused to take responsibility. This is nothing but a cheap way to extract extra money from customers.If you’re thinking about renting from Fox Rent a Car in Marrakesh, Morocco – DON’T!

"Kind of a mixed bag.  Made a reso through priceline for a vehicle at St. Maarten airport.  Shuttle experience was fine- Fox is actually Europcar there.  However, upon arriving at the office another client and I were told that there were no cars available, despite both of our confirmed reservations.  The manager said that he was only honoring pre-paid reservations.  The other gent ended up securing a car after he told them that a local friend had called to make the reso.  I think I looked so deflated and defeated that they decided they had a car for me after all.  The next shuttle arrives and I heard them tell 10 more people there were no cars available even though they also had reservations-  who knows how many people were in the same situation.My rental ended up being fine, but only through luck-  if pre-payment is required they should relay this to priceline, or just ensure the number of reservations matches the number of vehicles (seems pretty basic logic for a car rental company).

"The employee working at the Salt Lake City Fox Rent a Car counter directly lied to me. The whole Fox rental procedure is systemically designed to defraud renters. Here was my experience, which I observed replicated for the customers before and after me. First, they imply that renters must get a Loss Damage Waiver. This is not necessary, but Fox calls one level the ""minimum"" level, when in fact a LDW is not required. When asked about it, the employee suggested that I had to have proof that my insurance would cover rental car damage. When I pushed on this, she admitted the proof she had just asked for was not required. Next, she tried to email the contract to ensure that the I did not see that the LDW and roadside assistance had been added.I asked for a printed copy and saw that these fees were there. I asked her to remove the LDW and she told me it had been removed. I then did the vehicle inspection and returned the form to her. In fact, she had not removed the LDW. Had I then asked for a new printout of the contract, I would have seen this, but I stupidly trusted that it had been removed. After checking in the car, on my way to the airport, I found out that I had been charged an additional $380 in fees I had specifically, explicitly declined and had been told had been removed.Moral of the story -- don't drive away until you have a printed contract in your hand showing that no additional fees are being charged.",1,US,2024-12-26,Negative,employee work salt lake city fox rent car counter directly lie whole fox rental procedure systemically design defraud renter experience observe replicate customer first imply renter must get loss damage waiver necessary fox call one level minimum level fact ldw require ask employee suggest proof insurance would cover rental car damage push admit proof ask require next try email contract ensure see ldw roadside assistance addedi ask print copy see fee ask remove ldw tell remove vehicle inspection return form fact remove ldw ask new printout contract would seen stupidly trust removed checking car way airport found charge additional fee specifically explicitly decline tell removedmoral story do not drive away print contract hand show additional fee charge,26,December,2024

"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! This was the WORST rental experience I have ever had or imagined. We reserved and paid for a full size SUV (7-9 seat) to Caravan to Florida from Georgia (we live locally) specifically to fit 7 people to a wedding.  Not only did they say they didn't have any more full sizes, they refuse to compensate for our reservation in any way. I was at one point hung up by their billing department saying they will have a supervisor call me (never did). We had to take 2 cars to get all of us there (which of course defeated the whole purpose). I am most frustrated that we kept being put off to reach out after returning for compensation only to be told there was no solution. I assume this was so we didn't return the vehicle right away.

"We rented a vehicle at Fox in Las Vegas. The price quoted was $224. We fillled it full with gas prior to bring ing back. Dropped it off with Fox employee. He provided paper to us. The next day I reviewed all my credit charges online with my Visa company and saw where Fox charged $330! I called and a person named Michael stated the charge was for not bringing the car back full and they had to put 11 gallons back into it.  What? It was full.  He said that if I wanted to question it, that I would need to send screenshots of my credit card bill. So I did this; still no response after two weeks. So I called again and spoke to another employee and they gave me another email to use. I sent same info to him and still no response. Now it has been 22 days and no email response. I am very disappointed in how they can add fake charges. The tank was full!

"On 10/30/24, during the car rental process at Fox Rent A car. I was pressured into signing a car rental agreement in a small tablet with just the signature/initial box without letting me see what I am signing.  All I saw was the blank signature/initial box that Christina at Fox Rent A Car Las Vegas asked me to sign and initial.  I don't even know I am signed up for all the rental car add-on of $379.42.  After I signed the agreement form, Christina gave me the agreement form of $521.75.  I asked “What is this $521.75 is for?  Since I already paid for the total car rental cost of $142.33 to Fox Rent A Car on my credit card on 10/28/24” Christina told me “It is a temporary credit card hold, and I won't be seeing this $521.75 hold after I returned the rental car”.  After I returned my rental car, I received a receipt of 521.75, in which $379.42 is the rental car add-on that I have no knowledge about that was charged to my credit card.  After checking my credit card account, those charges are real charge and are not temporary credit card hold like Christina said.  This transaction process is a scam and a very bad business practice, which is totally unacceptable.  In addition, I am being charged 6 times on airport shuttle fees when I only used the shuttle two times, to and from the airport. The pressure tactics, the lies, and doesn't let customers see what they are signing into lure customers on purchases of all the rental car add-on are unacceptable.

"Fox Rent-A-Car is an absolute disaster, and I would give ZERO STARS if I could. Not only did they fail to provide the service I paid for, but they also lied to my credit card company to avoid refunding $571.12. This company is a SCAM, and their shady practices are nothing short of theft.I booked an 11-day car rental on May 4, 2024, for $571.12, to visit my blind, widowed, 75-year-old auntie with stage 4 cancer. When her health emergency forced me to change my travel dates, Fox Rent-A-Car refused to apply my credit—on THREE separate occasions: June 3rd, June 9th, and July 17th.As a Lahaina wildfire survivor, I was adjusting to traffic disruptions from debris removal and road repairs. I pride myself on punctuality, yet on July 16th, I missed my flight for the first time in 50+ years due to road closures caused by wildfire debris removal, boulders, and guardrail repairs. I called Fox immediately to inform them I’d be 24 hours late and asked them to hold my reservation. Instead of helping, they forced me to cancel and charged $26 to rebook. After 36 minutes of waiting and multiple holds, they claimed ""computer problems"" prevented them from rebooking and told me to try online. I spent hours trying, but it didn’t work.When I arrived at their rental location, they claimed I had no reservation, they were out of cars, and they refused to honor my credit with their sister company. They attempted to charge me over $750 for fewer days than I originally booked—$250 MORE than I already paid—and told me I’d need to return the next day to pick up a car. My destination was 40 minutes away without traffic, leaving me stranded.When I asked for a supervisor, I was pressured to accept the inflated price. After I refused, they hung up on me again. Later that night, I saw the price had increased to $978.80, nearly double my original reservation cost.The worst part? Fox Rent-A-Car lied to my credit card company (Hawaiian Airlines Bank of Hawaii World Elite Mastercard). They falsely claimed they refunded $500 of my $571.12 on May 4th, 2024. This was a LIE—the $500 was a deposit charge unrelated to the $571.12 rental fee. Despite showing my Barclay statement proving this, my credit card company sided with Fox Rent-A-Car, claiming my dispute was only for $71.12 because ""services were rendered.""Fox Rent-A-Car repeatedly promised I could use my credit, but they failed every single time. The final blow? Being abandoned at the airport during a family emergency without a car and with no help from their so-called customer service, which was rude, incompetent, and repeatedly hung up on me.This company’s behavior is beyond unacceptable. They’ve kept over $500 of my money for MONTHS without providing any service. This is corporate greed at its worst—Fox Rent-A-Car feels entitled to keep my money while lying about refunds and failing to deliver the promised service.Let’s not forget that Fox Rent-A-Car is now owned by Europcar Mobility Group, one of Europe’s largest car rental companies. If this is how Europcar operates in the U.S., customers should beware on both continents! It seems Europcar has brought its corporate greed and deceptive practices to the U.S., leaving customers stranded and out hundreds of dollars.If you value your time, money, and sanity, STAY FAR AWAY from Fox Rent-A-Car and Europcar Mobility Group.

"I firmly believe I was intentionally DECEIVED by the agent at Denver Fox car rental. The agent told me that I would be passing through tolls and a pass was a requirement. Not that the tolls were actually optional express lanes. He talked about how expensive it would be if I chose to pay the tolls myself vs. getting a pass. Never haven driven in the state before, I was expecting toll booths like they have in the northeast where you really are required to pay to drive on the road. This was most definitely a deception. Additionally, I did NOT need the extra insurance and told the agent that. I told him that my insurance policy covered me when driving rentals and he responded ""okay.""At the end, when I asked why the numbers were so HIGH on the paperwork, he LITERALLY told me to IGNORE them because that was just the deposit, which would be returned to me after I returned the vehicle, and not to worry because I already pre-paid through Expedia. He definitely gave me the impression the ONLY additional charges would be for the pass (which I ultimately did not need) and gas if returned at half a tank (I returned it with a full tank). Yes, I should have read every single word of the paperwork and asked more questions. However, I have rented from multiple other car agencies -- Hertz, Enterprise, Budget, Dollar and Thrifty -- without ever occurring a single extra charge and didn't realize that I needed to guard myself against an unscrupulous rental agent. Stupidly, I believed his lies vs. reading the fine print. I believe that the Fox agent knew that I was tired after traveling for many hours, wasn't familiar with the roads or requirements in Colorado, and PREYED upon the fact that I was a single, older female traveling alone.

"I rented a Toyota Corolla from Fox at Chicago O'Hare.  The handling characteristics of the car did not seem quite right and it was very uncomfortable at speeds over 60mph.  When I arrived at my destination in Madison, WI, I looked at the tire treads and they appeared to be in poor condition.  The next morning, the low tire pressure caution light was on.  I purchased a tire pressure gauge and was shocked that 3 of the tires exceeded the limit of the tire pressure gauge (55 psi).  the 4th tire pressure was 24 psi.  The limit on the tire pressures was 35 for the front and 33 for the rear.  I called the Fox roadside assistance line,  was on hold for quite awhile and left a call back number.  Fox did not contact me, despite their automated voice indicating that they would.  There was no way that I could drive this car on freeways back to Chicago, so I called Fox roadside assistance the following morning and was able to reach a helpful agent.  He directed me to Discount Tire in Madison, WI.  The technician at Discount Tire stated ""looks like they were trying to kill you.""  The tires were ""shot"" from massive overinflation.  Fox agreed to have all 4 tires replaced.  Unfortunately, I missed the majority of scheduled events on my trip, as I had had a dangerous car, and spent my time performing Fox Car Rental's job for them.

"Fox Rent A Car is the least legitimate rental car company I have every encountered. When renting my car online, I specifically declined all insurance coverage in booking my rental. When on site, I did have to pay extra due to the need to rent a child safety seat. I made a comment to the rep that the charge on the documentation was higher than expected, and he said don't worry about it, it is just a deposit. Upon return of the car, I was charged far beyond just a child safety seat, even though I paid for the rental in advance. This is because of the excess insurance I did not authorize. To make matters worse, because they captured my digital signature, they were able to apply it to documents I never saw to make it look like I agreed to pay for the excess insurance, despite what I had been told about it being ""just a deposit.""

"I recently rented with fox - Orlando, after traveling all day and finally making it to my rental agency, i was handed the keys and told to sign a multitude of documents. One that I was told was ""Mandatory"" to sign was the loss damage waiver. I was told by Hakim that this was mandatory as i was renting a 15 passenger van, and it was classified as a commercial vehicle. So standing there with 5 kids my wife and inlaws, i signed. Once i got settle about 2am i called my credit card company which i booked through and they said it is no way mandatory and my travel card has it covered. I called back the billing dept at fox and told them to remove it. They said I could travel back to the rental agency and get it refunded or wait until i return the vehicle and call them back for the refund- i had 72 hours after i returned the vehicle for my refund. I asked them if they made note on my file that i called and requested it to be removed/refunded and they did state that it was clearly on my file. So the day i retuned my vehicle i called the billing dept and they stated they had to escalate this matter - it was escalated and weeks went by i never heard back, after calling a number of times i was told they would get in contact with via email. as another work week went by i called back and they said it was denied by the manager.

It started with the abnormally long wait time to get the car. It was the only counter that had a wait, and we soon discovered why. The attendants were chatting with customers regarding favorite TV shows, family lineage, etc even though it was 10pm with an hour and a half line of people waiting. Of course, their computer also encountered a ""glitch"" while we were trying to check in, which made them have to restart their computers. Then, we were deceived into believing that the state of Washington has so many tolls and were convinced to spend $12.99 a day for the toll pass. We didn't even come across a toll in the 6 days we were there while driving over 1000 miles. They will not refund the money. Finally, my son left his Nintendo Switch in the car and the parking attendant called and told us he had it, and that we needed to email lost and found to get it. We have not heard back in over a week, and when I try to call to check on it...my call gets directed to the Philippines where they have no access to anyone in Seattle.

"The absolute worst experience of my life. The check engine light came on the car the following morning (post pickup). We call roadside assistance and they told us that it’s probably nothing because the check engine light was not “flashing”. I asked her if they could come bring us a new “working car” since the closet FOX was an hour away from where we were staying and my husband still needed to drive to work. They let us know that if they didn’t see anything overtly wrong we would get charged for the exchange. Later that day my 8-year-old daughter found drug paraphernalia under the drivers seat. The following day the car stalled on highway with three little kids in tow. We tried our best to safely get over and eventually got it running again, but realized there was in fact something wrong with the car. Because the rental is in my husband’s name, he had to exchange the car. He needed the car for a work event in the evening so he had to do the exchange during regular work hours. It took him an hour to get there. He had to wait in the regular line. Then they had difficulty accessing his information (for whatever reason). He was there for over an hour. In all he was gone for about 3.5 hours. My husband works in sales, that is money and time we can’t get back. His boss was not too happy either. In short FOX is okay with US loosing money and time and renting us a lemon with drug paraphernalia in it, but god forbid they do what’s right and bring us working vehicle. When I inquired why they wouldn’t exchange the lemon, their response was because it’s cost them time and money. I guess time and money is only important when it involves their time and money.

They come across inconsiderate and definitely seemed like they didn't want to be there. The people that gave me the car didn't listen to my request that I am being given a wrong car. They said that is all they have, as I am looking at an SUV in the lot (they gave me a truck). They added insurance, when I said no.Thirdly, you would think that since I had to wait that the car would be in tip top shape.

"When I arrived at the check-in desk I declined the additional insurance.  The agent ignored that and proceeded to charge it anyway saying it was a ""hold"".  He also helpfully suggested he had activated a Florida Sunpass for me but did not explain that meant I would be charged a fixed daily amount for usage rather than by the toll roads used.  When I complained to the billing department they only produced the paperwork I had signed which I argue was under falsehoods and omissions represented by the agent.  It was a little tough to argue with the location agent since I had two toddlers pulling on me and a long drive ahead of us, meanwhile he was busy playing on his phone between customers.  Furthermore, when I tried to raise a complaint within the organization, they suggested they had ""passed my feedback to the location manager"".  They never apologized for the lies that were told to me or the things that were omitted and they refused to let me speak to the location manager to understand if they actually had received my feedback and instructed their employees to behave more reputably.  I've leaned my lesson and will never use them again nor suggest that anyone does.

"I am writing to share my recent experience with FOX Rent a Car service at Phoenix Airport, which unfortunately fell short of my expectations.Two months ago, I made a reservation for a full-size SUV for an upcoming April 7th, 2024, trip. However, upon arrival, I was disappointed to find that the vehicle provided was a small Jeep SUV that had a strong smell of smoke. Despite bringing this to the attention of your staff, I was informed that there were no other vehicles available, and I had no choice but to accept the car as is.During my rental period, I encountered further issues with the vehicle, particularly with its gear shifting mechanism. This forced me to return the car and make an additional trip, spending 2 hours out of my way to obtain a replacement. To my dismay, the replacement vehicle was still not the full-size SUV I had reserved.In addition to the vehicle-related issues, I found the level of customer service provided to be well below average. Communication was lacking, and there was a general lack of effort to address my concerns in a satisfactory manner.As a loyal customer, I expected a smoother and more accommodating experience. Unfortunately, my recent rental experience has left me feeling dissatisfied and inconvenienced.I hope that by sharing this feedback, they can take appropriate measures to improve their quality of service they provided to customers. Addressing issues such as vehicle quality and customer service responsiveness can go a long way in ensuring customer satisfaction and loyalty.I sincerely hope to see improvements in the future.",1,LU,2024-04-07,Negative,write share recent experience fox rent car service phoenix airport unfortunately fall short expectationstwo month ago make reservation fullsize suv upcoming april th trip however upon arrival disappoint find vehicle provide small jeep suv strong smell smoke despite bring attention staff inform vehicle available choice accept car isdure rental period encounter issue vehicle particularly gear shift mechanism force return car make additional trip spend hour way obtain replacement dismay replacement vehicle still fullsize suv reservedin addition vehiclerelate issue find level customer service provide well average communication lack general lack effort address concern satisfactory manneras loyal customer expect smoother accommodate experience unfortunately recent rental experience leave feel dissatisfied inconveniencedi hope share feedback take appropriate measure improve quality service provide customer address issue vehicle quality customer service responsiveness go long way ensure customer satisfaction loyaltyi sincerely hope see improvement future,7,April,2024

"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! NO ONE KNOWS what they are doing!!!! This is the worst car rental company I have ever dealt with. I decided to rent from them dues their supposed low rates and picked up a car at Burbank Airport. For starters, they did not provide any clear directions to fin them. Next, the wait was very long as the person in charge seemed to be confused, overwhelmed or maybe just a recently hire employed. Finally, they gave me a set of keys na direct me vaguely to a car but pointing in a general areas. I had to return and ask them where the car was and someone then went over an pointed to one (there were dozens nearby). I got in the vehicle and recognized that the keys did not work. Finally, they found the right car. When I went to return it 5 weeks later, I asked to extend it for 5 days and after I was processed, i looked at the bill and they were going to charge me $1300+ for 5 extra days!!! So, I went back to confront the employee at the desk who was confused as well and then looked at it and said, 'No, you are only being charged some $313.00 which was still expensive but I trusted what he said. Two days later, I got a call from the company and told me that I would have to pay a penalty for keeping the car out longer!!! I responded that their own employee had told me different, this in my response to the email they sent me. I then noted the charge on my credit or debit card for over $1300!! I waited till Monday to call to protest this exorbitant and blatantly insane charge esp. since their own employee had told me different when he clarified the charge for mt to be some $313 or so. Now, for the disaster part! Their call center is staffed by English speakers with a thick accent and it sounded like India. The woman who took my call said she would connect me with someone else since she could not deal with the situation. The next person, a woman, answered and asked me what the situation was and before I could explain, she kept interrupting me and I asked her to stop and listen first but she would NOT!! She kept talking over me rudely and repeatedly and said they had left me  a message (she must have been referring to a call from somebody 2 days after I had extended my reservation (this is when I found out that there was a penalty for taking if 5 more days which they said was because I had gone over 30 days. But I wrote back that I had actually already rented the car for one month plus a week, already beyond the so called 30 day period. The customer service woman was absolutely horrific and had no interest in dealing with me, a customer, in a manner befitting the fact that I was paying for something but now they were clearly ripping me off.

"FOX Rental Car (Orlando)1) Remote KeyFob didn't work -  Had to use my valuable vacation time to go to Auto Zone to purchase a new battery and install it.2) No windshield wiper fluid -  Had to use my valuable vacation time to go to Auto Zone and purchase washer fluid. I also had to fill the washer fluid reservoir.3) Proximity detection alert did not work - When I made the reservation I asked for a smaller SUV. Instead, the pickup agent only offered me a large Toyota 4Runner and said this would be better to drive. No, it wasn't. Especially harder to maneuver without the proximity alert.4 Liftgate auto-open with KeyFob did not work (even after battery replaced !!)5) Pickup agent was dishonest re: tolls - He told us that Florida's toll system was not convenient for visitors to the state. He said that if we didn't get the Tolls PlatePass that we would need to stop at every toll plaza and pay by cash (and some toll stations didn't have the cash option), else we would be ticketed and fined $300 per incident. He said there were no other options. After the fact, we found out that a Florida Visitor Toll Pass was available via a FREE App, so that we could get a toll sticker at the airport and only pay the amount Floridians pay for tolls. We were charged $103 for the week. I called other rental companies and they charge ~$70 per week, with no additional fees. In a nutshell, what Fox does is unethical.All of the above was discussed with the manager on 2/18/24 at Fox Rental-Orlando when I returned the car. The money I spent on the KeyFob battery and washer fluid was credited on the bill by Fox roadside assistance.

"Not happy with the rental. Car was OK, but received a wealth of misleading (mistruths) Information. 1) when I picked up the car at LAX I explicitly asked if I needed a transponder for tolls. ‘Are you going to San Diego?’  No I said. ‘Then you don’t need one. Be happy to rent you one, but you won’t need one.’  That’s incorrect. I did incur tolls on the trip to Carlsbad. Got billed and had a significant administrative fee.  Fox wouldn't respond to my inquiry.  2) Also, when I picked the car up the clerk said I could bring the car back less than full and they would ‘top it off’ at (approximately) $4.80 per gallon. They explicitly said ‘you don’t need to stop next door’—the gas station was right next to the pick up center. I therefore didn’t. Returned it 3/4 full. Told the guy that they told me they would top it off at $4 something. He said that’s not exactly right. They are going to charge you $51 to fill it. I asked why?  ‘That’s just what they do’. This was 5:30 in the morning and I was running late. Explicitly mislead twice. Purposely. Responded to Fox when they invited me to fill out a survey and never heard back from them.

"I recently had the misfortune of renting a car from Fox Rent a Car during a trip to Miami, and I feel compelled to share my nightmarish experience. From start to finish, the entire process was marred by deception, poor customer service, and a blatant disregard for customer satisfaction.My troubles began at the pickup counter, where a representative forcefully pushed additional services on me, falsely claiming they were mandatory. Despite my clear refusal, I found myself coerced into purchasing insurance and a PlatePass, causing my reservation total to skyrocket. This bait-and-switch tactic not only soured the beginning of my vacation but also left me questioning the integrity of Fox Rent a Car.Upon realizing the misrepresentation, I reached out to the manager the next day seeking a refund or an option to return the car. Instead of addressing the issue, I was told returning the car would cost me $350 early return fee (the total amount in the original booking), which was extremely unfair given the circumstances. The manager conveniently failed to mention that the insurance is only mandatory if the driver lacks personal insurance – information that would have influenced my decision not to purchase it.Despite reaching out to the operations manager via email and filing a claim with the Consumer Protection Office of Miami-Dade County, Fox Rent a Car has shown a blatant lack of concern for customer grievances. The operations manager's response was dismissive and unhelpful.This entire experience has left me thoroughly dissatisfied with Fox Rent a Car's deceptive practices and abysmal customer service. I would strongly advise anyone considering their services to think twice and explore alternative options. Fox Rent a Car's lack of transparency, disregard for customer concerns, and refusal to rectify the situation have left me with a bitter taste and an unwavering determination to share my experience to spare others from a similar fate.In conclusion, my recommendation is clear: steer clear of Fox Rent a Car unless you're willing to risk a ruined trip and a severe dent in your wallet. There are countless reputable car rental companies out there, and Fox Rent a Car is undoubtedly not one of them.",1,US,2024-01-06,Negative,recently misfortune renting car fox rent car trip miami feel compelled share nightmarish experience start finish entire process marred deception poor customer service blatant disregard customer satisfactionmy trouble begin pickup counter representative forcefully push additional service falsely claim mandatory despite clear refusal find coerced purchasing insurance platepass cause reservation total skyrocket baitandswitch tactic sour beginning vacation also leave question integrity fox rent carupon realize misrepresentation reach manager next day seek refund option return car instead address issue tell return car would cost early return fee total amount original booking extremely unfair give circumstance manager conveniently fail mention insurance mandatory driver lack personal insurance information would influence decision purchase itdespite reach operation manager via email filing claim consumer protection office miamidade county fox rent car show blatant lack concern customer grievance operation manager response dismissive unhelpfulthis entire experience leave thoroughly dissatisfied fox rent car deceptive practice abysmal customer service would strongly advise anyone consider service think twice explore alternative option fox rent car lack transparency disregard customer concern refusal rectify situation leave bitter taste unwavere determination share experience spare other similar fatein conclusion recommendation clear steer clear fox rent car unless you re willing risk ruin trip severe dent wallet countless reputable car rental company fox rent car undoubtedly one,6,January,2024

Never use FOX or EuropeCar!I booked a car via Rentalcars with all possible insurances but yet to face no other choice than to accept to purchase same insurance at my destination or no car. In fact they said it’s nothing to do with them despite my booking. The total amount for my rental ended to be almost three times the value compared to my initial booking with same coverage. Rentalcars are aware of this trick and write upon booking the following: “At the rental desk you will be offered an equivalent product to this one but it will less inclusions and it will cost twice the price. With your protection you can say “no” to the hard sell for collision damage waivers or similar excess reduction products at the pick up desk - you’re already protected”.

This was my first time renting a car from an airport service. It was super easy. The line was a bit long at pickup. Roughly 25 mins.  They gave me a free upgrade to the luxury class!  I got a 2023 Chrysler 300S with only 4K miles. It was fun playing with all the tech and integration for 11 days and it only cost 235 bucks. After reading a few 1 star reviews I wanted to add some info about my payment experience. I prepaid the rental with my mom’s debit card on Expedia. I used my credit card for the 150.00 deposit. They only held the funds for about 7 days before releasing the deposit(while I still had the car for 3 more days). They tried to upsell insurance and refueling. I declined both and didn’t pay an extra cent. I refueled for 3.50/g they offered to do it for 4.30. I spent 4 bucks at the self car wash vacuuming the muddy carpets and hosing off 10 days of mud and snow before I dropped it off. The guy walked around the car and said I’m good. They emailed me a receipt within 10 mins that said I owe nothing more. 235 for 10.5 days. 400 miles cost me 70 bucks in fuel.,5,CA,2024-01-18,Positive,first time rent car airport service super easy line bit long pickup roughly min give free upgrade luxury class get chrysler k mile fun play tech integration day cost buck read star review wanted add info payment experience prepay rental mom debit card expedia use credit card deposit hold fund day release depositwhile still car day try upsell insurance refueling decline do not pay extra cent refuel g offer spend buck self car wash vacuum muddy carpet hose day mud snow drop guy walk around car say I m good email receipt within min say owe nothing day mile cost buck fuel,18,January,2024

If they read this review, one suggestion I have is to provide insurance at a better rate.  There is an insurance you can purchase online that is over $10 less expensive but it is through a 3rd party.  It would make it easier to just get the insurance from FOX for only a couple of $ more.

Terrible! Fox Car Rental deserves to be out of business. I used my Visa card to make a pre-paid reservation for a mid size car at Dallas international Airport through Expedia. Upon arrival I was denied the rental because the same visa card that I used for the pre-paid rental was also a debit card. It has two functions as a Visa Credit and a bank debit card in one card. But the employee there had never heard of it and refused to even try to run my Visa card. I was just flat out rejected and told that I’d lose my deposit.  Refund was declined. Expedia escalated the case and said they were wrong but yet Fox car rental does not care. They don’t care about their customers.

"After being forced to buy insurance by the person at the counter (even after I had said I was using my credit card and she acknowledged that), I got home and went onto their website to chat. The rep confirmed that no insurance was required. I literally said, ""So she basically lied to get extra money out of me."" He replied ""Yes."" He told me to GO BACK to the airport to get them to take it off. That he couldn't do it. I found that hard to believe and really didn't feel that it was my responsibility to go back there, pay to park, get into a confrontation with the manager (read other reviews) to fight for something that they never should have forced upon me.I read the Google reviews of this place and had, within a few hours, written to the email address provided in all of the responses (they say give them 48 hrs to respond). I included the chat, a few screenshots of others saying how they had been forced to buy insurance and I gave them 6 days to respond before writing this. They have not written back.The woman at the counter was not very polite to begin with, talked fast, made me agree to purchase insurance before continuing on with the rental (saying it was MANDATORY). When I showed her my receipt asking to show me where it said that, she said: ""The total at the bottom is an estimate...because you didn't choose insurance."" I had paid up front for the rental.By the way, this is the first place I've come across that does not put a HOLD on your card for the deposit...they CHARGE you for it. And even though I have returned the car 2 days ago, of course I haven't gotten the refund yet. I'm sure they do this so when they screw you on the ""mandatory"" insurance, it's one way they get their money. Then they only refund you the ""difference"" which in my case is NOT the $150 but the amount of the ""mandatory"" insurance as well.So if the company is going to respond to me saying email them, check your email because it's been sitting there since Wednesday. And stop forcing people to buy your insurance which credit cards or personal insurance already cover. It's just bad business and you've lost another customer.",1,GB,2024-01-04,Negative,force buy insurance person counter even say use credit card acknowledge get home go onto website chat rep confirm insurance require literally say basically lie get extra money reply yes tell go back airport get take could not find hard believe really do not feel responsibility go back pay park get confrontation manager read review fight something never force upon mei read google review place within hour write email address provide response say give hrs respond include chat screenshot other say force buy insurance give day respond writing write backthe woman counter polite begin talk fast make agree purchase insurance continue rental say mandatory show receipt asking show say say total bottom estimatebecause do not choose insurance pay front rentalby way first place I ve come across put hold card depositthey charge even though return car day ago course have not get refund yet I m sure screw mandatory insurance one way get money refund difference case amount mandatory insurance wellso company go respond say email check email sit since wednesday stop force people buy insurance credit card personal insurance already cover bad business you ve lose another customer,4,January,2024

"Looking at the location I initially hesitated to book a car here, but I was wrong. Plus: 1. Fox shuttle service to and from Airport Car Rental service area is for every 5 to 10 mins. We reached the LV Airport Car Rental Service center at 1:00 am. I did not call the Fox rental, but their shuttle came exactly at 1:05 am to pick any passenger to Fox Rental location. Not sure, if they know the flight timing. While returning the car around 3:30 AM, their shuttle service took us back to the Airport Car Rental service center. Again it was only a 5 mins wait. They have multiple shuttle service van, which runs continuously. Point is, do not worry about the shuttle service from FOX rental to Airport rental center2. I was given a brand new car with no license plate. Went there the next day to exchange it with another car having license plate, as I had to travel to SFO. With no hassle they swapped it3. I did a prepaid thru Expedia. $30 was charged to my card after my rental. Called the customer care with a 1 min wait time. The billing was corrected as it was a prepaid. No penny was charged apart from my prepaid.4. Though the location of this rental is in bit outskirts, the compound is safer. Once you are in the location, its safe. The staff just waits for you to drop the car and the checkout process is on the spot though it was 3:30 AMFox rental will be my goto place next time.  Minus:1. During the daytime the place is very crowded. May be Christmas time and flight arrival time. It was a long line with less staffs. May be once in a while and depends on the timing.2.

"On a scale from 1-10 my score would be about a 7+. The biggest problem I had with Fox Rent-A-Car Oakland airport was that it took over an hour to get my car in a line of two people ahead of me.

I don’t know what was going on with a couple of people at the counters that were having some obvious rental issues with documentations or what have you but an hour in line was just unacceptable especially for myself and one other customer who I was speaking with that had Prepaid reservations. Once I got my car, I was totally satisfied with the vehicle. Everything was OK but still one hour in line was just unacceptable with no explanation or apology give. The rate that I paid for my car was great and the vehicle was great. At one point in time, I was almost ready to go to another car rental agency that had no wait time, moving people from the counter to their cars in around 10 minutes or less. My suggestion to Fox at Oakland Airport Rent-A-Car Center is to have an express lane for people with reservations so they won’t have to endure an hour long wait when there’s only two people in line.",3,US,2023-12-19,Neutral,scale score would big problem fox rentacar oakland airport take hour get car line two people ahead middle week mid morning two counter agent work rental car center be not busy do not know go couple people counter obvious rental issue documentation hour line unacceptable especially one customer speak prepay reservation get car totally satisfied vehicle everything ok still one hour line unacceptable explanation apology give rate pay car great vehicle great one point time almost ready go another car rental agency wait time move people counter car around minute less suggestion fox oakland airport rentacar center express lane people reservation will not endure hour long wait there s two people line,19,December,2023

The man that drove the shuttle was very attentive and got me on board really quickly. The car was great, the packages for gas and toll were fair.

"The lines are shorter at pick up than the other major carriers. You must have a credit card and enough on your limit to be charged a $500.00 fee upfront.You must  have this card with you at pick up and Not a debit card. Don’t use a third party vendor (such as Priceline), as they will allow you to make a reservation with the debit card, then when you get to the counter, you will need a credit card. They will also charge you a fee, that you can save by booking directly at the Fox site. I saw this happen to a poor soul who was ahead of me at the pick up counter. After waiting to get to the counter, he had to find out they don’t take a debit card and be turned away to the other car rentals that take a debit card.  Go to the Fox site to reserve your car and all the policies are there. The return policy is odd at my location, where when you arrive, you just park it in returns and leave the keys and go. For me this caused an issue, and the receipt emailed showed a different return time than my actual return time. I was then charged for being late. This was after standing in line for 10 minutes at the return kiosk, only to be told, “leave the keys and go”, once it was my turn at the window. On a previous return, there was a staff member there taking keys and not checking the car at all. So, the idea is they will hit you on your bill if there is something wrong, and in my case, I was charged for being 1 minute late (their time), which was annoying, since I was 10 minutes early. Other than those issues, it is a pretty reasonable price when you book directly.

"Great service, relatively quick given that the LA location is busy. The only issue that I've experienced is that the communication/process for a small incident (rock to windshield) is NOT consistent between their roadside assistance and Fox procedures. Roadside assistance insisted I had to repair the vehicle before turning it in, costing me time and money (that I will get back with AMEX rental coverage). I turn it in and guess what... I didn't have to repair it myself, I could of exchanged it. But I couldn't get a hold of the location to ask the question and when I did get a hold of someone through their online chat, they referred me to roadside assistance... so either way it would have ended up the way that it did. I'm getting my money back, but just frustrating that I wasted time due to a lack of guidance and clarity from both Fox and their roadside assistance. BUT, in all other aspects, they were a pleasure doing business and was really quick in getting me a vehicle at a great price in the area. 4 stars for the lack of guidance/runaround but great in-person service/speediness. I hope that this serves as warning to people renting that a small incident (like rock to windshield) you don't have to spend your limited time to repair, but can exchange or drop off.",4,CA,2023-12-16,Positive,great service relatively quick give la location busy issue I ve experience communicationprocess small incident rock windshield consistent roadside assistance fox procedure roadside assistance insist repair vehicle turn cost time money get back amex rental coverage turn guess do not repair could exchange could not get hold location ask question get hold someone online chat refer roadside assistance either way would ended way I m get money back frustrating waste time due lack guidance clarity fox roadside assistance aspect pleasure business really quick get vehicle great price area star lack guidancerunaround great inperson servicespeediness hope serve warn people rent small incident like rock windshield do not spend limited time repair exchange drop,16,December,2023

The communication was straightforward and transparent, and we appreciated the reasonable refund we received on our credit card for the unused gas.Overall, our experience with Fox Rental Car turned out to be very positive.

"I was apprehensive about renting from Fox due to reviews from other locations.  However, according to Expedia, the Fox location in Phoenix had better levels than Budget, etc.  That being said, the experience at the registration counter was great.  When we arrived to the vehicle pickup location there was nobody in the booth.  We headed to the spot number we were given to pickup our minivan.  There was two to choose from.  One of the Fox team showed up and we made our selection from the two vehicles.  I always take a video of the exterior and interior of the vehicles I rent for my records.  There were quite a bit of door creases, panel dents and dings on the vehicle.  Obviously they don't affect the driveability of the vehicle, but never the less it looks bad!  The vehicle had over 77,000 miles on it, again not a big deal, but it seems like a lot of miles for a rental.  Here is where I had issues with the vehicle.  Upon opening the tailgate we found that the trunk area well carpet was missing, there was an absolute ton of dog hair inside the vehicle.  Luckily none of us have allergies to dog!  The inside of the vehicle front windshield was horrendous!  The amount of dirt, haze and film were unbelievable.  When driving facing the sun it was difficult to see out the window! To top it off, when we left the rental car garage we left the facility and found that the back two tires were low on air to the point that the car was warning us about it!  I had to go fill up the back tires which cost me $5 to get air from a convenience machine.  Honestly, the pricing was good, but cleanliness is important regardless of the price paid for the rental.",4,US,2023-12-09,Positive,apprehensive renting fox due review location however accord expedia fox location phoenix well level budget etc say experience registration counter great arrive vehicle pickup location nobody booth head spot number give pickup minivan two choose one fox team show make selection two vehicle always take video exterior interior vehicle rent record quite bit door crease panel dent ding vehicle obviously do not affect driveability vehicle never less look bad vehicle mile big deal seem like lot mile rental issue vehicle upon opening tailgate find trunk area well carpet miss absolute ton dog hair inside vehicle luckily none we allergie dog inside vehicle front windshield horrendous amount dirt haze film unbelievable driving face sun difficult see window top leave rental car garage leave facility find back two tire low air point car warn we go fill back tire cost get air convenience machine honestly price good cleanliness important regardless price pay rental,9,December,2023

"Me and my wife thought would have a lousy off-airport car rental experience, but turned out surprisingly easy, quick and comfortable. The shuttle bus took us from Salt Lake International Airport to the Fox car rental center for only about seven minutes. When we got there, there was no waiting line. I showed my reservation confirmation to the front lady. She was friendly, polite, and very easy to talk with. The whole interaction was completed very quickly. I remembered she did mention about additional options for us about the rental car reservation, but there was no overly aggressive and forceful selling of car upgrades, insurance coverages, and gas savings. I got the car exactly as what I reserved for among many other good cars, nice and clean, on the parking lot. Then we drove 3.5 hours to Moab. For the next six days we visited Arches & Canyonlands National Parks. we drove to many trailheads and did a lot of our long planned hiking. The Toyota Camry we rented full filled our needs. It’s powerful, comfortable, and gas saving. we enjoyed every bit of this car. At the end of our seven day vacation, we drove back to the rental station to drop off the car, and that process was swift. we were treated respectfully and friendly by everyone in the Fox car rental center. I’ve had a handful of car rental experiences before. This one stands out above all else. I would be definitely happy to recommended Fox car rental to others.

"We booked a car from Fox through a third party website, and got, what we thought was a great deal. We were quoted £427 for 14 days rental.  It ended up costing us almost £1400. When we arrived at the desk, we were told that we had to buy their insurance, and toll charges, otherwise it would cost us a lot more if we didn't.  We were tired from the long flight, and worried that we wouldn't have transport for our holiday, so we had to agree to that.  He scrolled through his tablet to the bottom and asked us to sign, which we did, and then asked for a $1300 deposit.  We were shocked at the amount, but thought we would get most of it back at the end. He did not give us a copy of the signed agreement, so we couldn't look at what they had charged us. It wasn't until we got home and rang them to send us a copy, that we saw that there were, in total, 12 charges on there that we were not expecting.  They had added optional extras, that we had NOT been asked if we wanted, so really were not optional at all, they just added them anyway.  All those things, of course increased the tax. So in the end we did not get any deposit back, and on top of what we had already paid when we booked it, cost us £1400, almost as much as our holiday. We were absolutely gutted, that totally ruined our time there, we have never had problems like that before when we have booked rentals through other companies.  Fox car rentals need to be more transparent about their charges, and make sure the customer is absolutely clear about what they are signing for.  And maybe re-train their staff, instead of letting them get away with the underhand selling that we experienced.

"1st time user of your company. Visiting my daughter for her birthday and Miguel upgraded our car and no extra charge to my daughters favorite SUV, she was so excited when we showed up in that.  Miguel was very professional, courteous and friendly. Very good customer service skills.  Downside would be we had to inspect the vehicle with very little light and it was wet from being washed, so we missed a lot of minor damage we didn't mark on the paper card and was worried we would get changed.  Very happy you did not charge us for those items.  Now the older ""exit security guard"" male that greeted you as you exited the lot after picking up the car was very rude, NO customer service skills at all.  Had we not had such good customer service with Miguel, we would have probably planned on not using your company again because of that ""exit security guard"" guy.

"We really appreciated your staff member Charnika at the Oakland Airport. Prior to serving us she had a difficult client who seemed to require extra service and didn't quite have everything they needed to secure their rental.

Beyond that I am hard of hearing and while I could not hear everything, she said, she was apologetic, patient, extremely understanding and accommodating.  She went above and beyond to ensure we understood and had everything we needed.

When we booked to rent from them in Las Vegas we couldn't believe how cheap they are compared to the main rental places. Their location in San Francisco was right at the airport.

There was another renter there who said be sure to look at the tires because they rented a vehicle that had worn tires. That's a small inconvenience for saving 50% or more on a rental. Great value!

"Ivan at the MIA office is very nice. We had dropped off one vehicle and was picking up another when I realised I forgot my passport. He said that he could not rent us the vehicle because we must have our passports even though I indicated we just dropped off one. My only suggestion to Fox is if you have a recurring customer that their documents be stored on file so they don’t have to keep presenting original documents each time, especially in our instance where we just dropped back a vehicle to pick up another one. We had to Uber back to our apartment and return with our passports. Ivan showed a high level of empathy when he realised how frustrated and tired we were and told us not to worry to full the tank on return to make up for the Uber. While the rental was only for about 15 hours and the gas needle hardly budged as it was just to make 2 trips, it was a great show of customer service, empathy and he left us with a great customer experience which is more important that the service itself. We would like to express our gratitude to Ivan for turning what started as a negative experience to a positive one. In terms of charges, we had to take the third party liability insurance as we were informed it is a mandatory requirement for rentals in Florida by law. There online chat is very responsive and I appreciated the consistency of the information. I was informed that third party liability is $13.20 per day in the chat, and at the office we were informed that the information we received was accurate. We also opted to pay for CDW via the third party booking site at $10 per day, as at the office this insurance can range from $13-$20 per day depending on the level of coverage you want. This can result to paying close to $35 per day for insurance coverage. I have booked with them several times already at the MIA office and have never had a problem with excessive charges or funds debiting from my credit card months after as some other rental company does.",4,US,2023-09-26,Positive,ivan mia office nice drop one vehicle pick another realise forgot passport say could rent us vehicle must passport even though indicate drop one suggestion fox recur customer document store file do not keep present original document time especially instance drop back vehicle pick another one uber back apartment return passport ivan show high level empathy realise frustrated tired tell we worry full tank return make uber rental hour gas needle hardly budge make trip great show customer service empathy leave we great customer experience important service would like express gratitude ivan turning start negative experience positive one term charge take third party liability insurance inform mandatory requirement rental florida law online chat responsive appreciated consistency information inform third party liability per day chat office inform information receive accurate also opt pay cdw via third party booking site per day office insurance range per day depend level coverage want result pay close per day insurance coverage book several time already mia office never problem excessive charge fund debit credit card month rental company,26,September,2023

The manager 1st didnt want us to leave because they could be liable. I understand i explained but i the renter is the liable one and only then she allowed it to be stored.

"This is the first, and last, time I rent from Fox. To begin, we arrived in Phoenix, AZ, and did not get the type of car we requested, a standard size, Toyota Camry-like car. Instead, we were presented with a Nissan Rogue, with no cover over the back luggage compartment and over 73,000 miles on it.  Driving out of the airport, we noticed the hood was loose. We pulled over to securely fasten the hood. We arrived at our first stop, Sedona, AZ, from Phoenix, and had a peaceful night. In the morning, with plans to explore, the car would not start. Contacting Fox roadside assistance, we were told that they would contact a service agency to jump start the car.  After three hours, and several phone calls back to Fox, a repair person showed up for the jump start. In doing so, he indicated that the battery was shot and probably wouldn't hold the charge. He suggested we take it in for a new battery.  More phone calls to Fox. They gave us the name of a service center to contact. We contacted them and were told that they could certainly change the battery, but they wouldn't guarantee that it would be done that day or even the next. On our own, we contacted several auto shops and found one that would replace the battery that day for us. We took the car over and had a late lunch while the battery was changed. When we picked up the car, we were told that the oil was low, the coolant was low, and the air filter was filthy. (Fox agreed to pay for the new battery as long as I had the record of the failed battery test which I had.) Another call to Fox demanding a drivable car. I was told to take the car back to Phoenix or to Salt Lake City and wait for an inspection to determine the drivability of the car. I was also told that if the car passed the inspection I would personally have to pay for the inspection and still drive the same car. Taking another day out of my trip was impossible so I decided to drive the car as it was, with my fingers crossed that it wouldn't break down on the trip. While driving, the dashboard warning lights continually came on indicating low tire pressure and faulty air bags. When I checked the door for the tag with the recommended tire pressure, the tag had been removed.  Also, there was no tire gauge in the car to check the tire pressure. I had to buy one! Once the tires warmed up and once the car had been running for a while, the dashboard warning lights went off. When I finally got to a place where I was staying for several days, I contacted several auto shops to see if they could address the problems with the oil, coolant, air filter and tire pressure. On the way, during a rainstorm I realized that the wiper blades were disintegrating and ready to fall off. Also, there was no washer fluid available in the car. After being told by several repair shops that they couldn't take the car until ""next week"" I finally found one that would take the car the next day. Next morning, in the shop, (Grease Monkeys in Durango, CO), the oil was topped off, coolant added, air filter replaced, wiper blades replaced, and tire pressure checked. (Thankfully, Fox did pay for this service.) The rest of my trip was without incident.  This car, with over 73,000 miles on it, should NEVER have been allowed to leave the rental agency. The worry and concern while driving this car was constant and should never have happened. Explanation given. I will never rent from Fox again.",1,US,2023-09-13,Negative,first last time rent fox begin arrive phoenix az get type car request standard size toyota camrylike car instead present nissan rogue cover back luggage compartment mile drive airport notice hood loose pull securely fasten hood arrive first stop sedona az phoenix peaceful night morning plan explore car would start contact fox roadside assistance tell would contact service agency jump start car three hour several phone call back fox repair person show jump start indicate battery shot probably would not hold charge suggest take new battery phone call fox give we name service center contact contact tell could certainly change battery would not guarantee would done day even next contact several auto shop find one would replace battery day we take car late lunch battery change pick car tell oil low coolant low air filter filthy fox agree pay new battery long record fail battery test another call fox demand drivable car tell take car back phoenix salt lake city wait inspection determine drivability car also tell car pass inspection would personally pay inspection still drive car take another day trip impossible decide drive car finger cross would not break trip drive dashboard warning light continually come indicate low tire pressure faulty air bag check door tag recommend tire pressure tag remove also tire gauge car check tire pressure buy one tire warm car run dashboard warning light go finally get place stay several day contact several auto shop see could address problem oil coolant air filter tire pressure way rainstorm realize wiper blade disintegrate ready fall also washer fluid available car tell several repair shop could not take car next week finally find one would take car next day next morning shop grease monkeys durango co oil top coolant add air filter replace wiper blade replace tire pressure check thankfully fox pay service rest trip without incident car mile never allow leave rental agency worry concern drive car constant never happen explanation given never rent fox,13,September,2023

"My wife and I travelled to California for a gathering to celebrate the birth of our grandchild which was scheduled to begin at 1 PM.  The timing was close (only 2 hours from landing to the time for the gathering) but it was the best we could do.  I reserved a car with Fox and noted that the drive from the LA Fox office to the house where the party would be held was only 20 minutes.  This helped relieve my anxiety about the timing.  As it turned out our plane landed at the LAX airport at 11 am on Sunday, Sept 24, leaving us plenty of time (we thought) to get the car and get to the party.   When we entered the Fox office at 12:45 my heart sank.  There were at least 40 people in line and only three agents working.  20 minutes later a fourth agent arrived.  It took us until 12:40 PM to get up to the agent and sign in.  We were now late for the party.  Finally, we were signed in and proceeded to the garage to collect our car.  Anther long line. It was explained that our car, which we had now waited almost an hour for, was not “ready.”  It needed to be “cleaned” and we must wait our turn.  “See, all these people are ahead of you, and they have been waiting.”  We said we would take it no matter how dirty it was.  The agent politely explained that this was not possible.  The wait was another ½ hour.  By the time we got to the gathering that we had travelled all the way across the country to attend, the guests were leaving and we had missed several of the people we came to see.There is no system to warn the customer ahead of time.  We could have rented another car, albeit at a higher price, had we been warned at the airport that there would be a wait of over an hour to get our car.  Once you have waited for the shuttle bus and been dropped off at the Fox site (35 minutes), it is too late. They have sucked you in and you are at their mercy.  To get another car at that point would easily take at least an hour not counting the wait for the Uber.  This happens regularly, so I am told.  The line still numbered 40 people when we finally left the facility.  Another shuttle was just pulling up. The lack of a warning is willful disregard of the customer.Another complaint: The model I reserved was not available.  We were given instead the civilian equivalent of an Abrams tank that we could not park anywhere.  No price adjustments. One thing I must add:  ALL of the people at the facility were respectful, cheerful and apologetic.Still…Not fair.

"Note my revision at the bottom.I am generally very careful about renting a car and the prices quoted, but you need to be very careful with Fox (and other low-cost rental companies).  I told them I did not want liability insurance and yet they put it on the contract. You don't see what you're signing on the pin pad until afterwards so be sure to look at the paper copy. I didn't notice it. They charged me $13 a day extra for rental liability insurance I did not want.  Don't trust what the agent says. Only the words in the contract count. In addition, they charge a large early fee (yes, they charge you if you are too early! $35) or late return fee even if it's just a little more than an hour either way.  They charged me a late fee of $40 (instead of just another day's rental at $15/day) when I was 90 minutes late and charged for another day's liability insurance that I didn't want in the first place for a total of about $50.Calling customer service does no good. They don't have any ability to change anything since it is all on the contract and they are just a call center. They have bad business practices even though they are legally covered.The car itself was fine.UPDATE Sept 15, 2023: Got an email from the manager of the location and I explained my problems. She corrected the problems and issued a refund cheerfully without question.

"I had a great experience with Fox Car Rental out of Denver. Walked right up to the shuttle and picked up right away. Waited shortly once at the location and was greeted warmly by Chris. He helped me find a great car and I ended up stepping into a brand new (1650 miles) Dodge Challenger. The car was perfect for my time in Colorado and performed perfectly. On my way back to Denver, Interstate 70 closed unexpectedly because of a forest fire. I called immediately to let them know and they proactively extended my rental with no extra charge. Once I was able to get to Denver, the drop off was quick and easy and I was charged exactly what I was expecting. Factor in the price of my rental, I'd say it was above and beyond my expectations. i know there is a some polarity with peoples experiences, but mine was very good and next time I'm renting out of Denver, I will be choosing Fox again.

"I've rented from many other companies in the past, some on the more budget side but mainly the bigger names. We wanted to have a car for several days but knew we wouldn't be using it a ton and so just didn't want to have to pay a lot.  The online booking experience was great... I was waiting for the rate to suddenly skyrocket because so often what you see is really a teaser rate and then by the time all the fees are added on you might as well have rented from Hertz. But pleasantly surprised that, while there were a few fees, the rate was pretty much the same.  Similarly, the pickup process was smooth and fairly painless with the only slight complaint being that there were 10-12 people waiting in line and only two people serving. But when I spoke to the guy who checked me out there was no hard sell to get the insurance, he was excited to tell me that you guys now had a gas pump on site and so just bring the car in empty and the price for gas should be the same or cheaper than at a local gas station. Car was clean and very nice. On our return... I had intended to get gas before returning, but just forgot, but was pleasantly surprised again that when I received notification of my final bill the gas price was pretty much what I had thought I would pay to fill it myself.

We were forced to pay nearly double ($429) At the rental counter, we were told that this was because they were being forced to upgrade us to a Honda SUV. Since we had already flown across the country and were meeting friends for this trip, we were forced to take what they could give us. The vehicle they gave us was NOT an upgrade. It was NOT a Honda. It was not an SUV. It was a Hyundai Kona, which could not even hold our bags in the back end.

As opposed to broken or missing seats that they had to stand and hold on. We had no problem at the pickup counter. Cynthia gave us a free upgrade and lots of suggestions on what to see in Colorado. She was friendly and funny.  Then upon our return it went smoothly. As soon as we arrived to drop off the airport van was waiting to take us to the airport. Off to the airport then we realized that we had left our laptop in the SUV! We told the van driver. He called the drop-off and told them.

"It was ok. This location at the time of my visit was very busy and did not have cars available. Had to wait for a vehicle only to get a vehicle that I did not reserve and didn't want, however the manager made up for my inconvenience by offering me a free tank of gas and made a note of it on the vehicle inspection sheet, which made me feel better because I can now return it empty. It was one of those vehicles that required a lot of gas. On my return I explained to the returning attendant what transpired and showed her the piece of paper where the note was made and she assured me that I will not be billed for the fill up. The next day I checked my email for the receipt and there it was $170.xx in refueling cost added to my invoice.

I initially went to the wrong shuttle area 3) I thought one shuttle would swing by all the different off airport rental car agencies.

I had basically reserved a hire car using a 3rd party site.  Upon arrival to the Fox Orlando, FL location (after a long day of travelling from Canada), I confirmed my details etc.  The part to be aware of is to ensure that you get the counter sales rep to explicitly run through the whole invoice before you electronically sign the invoice.Ultimately, the counter sales rep guy conveniently omitted mentioning that he had included 3 optional extras: Loss Damage Waiver (LDW), Supplemental Liability Insurance (SLI) and PlatePass (ATS) in my invoice.As this is signed for using an electronic screen, all he said to me was can you write you initial on the screen without explaining that I was inadvertently signing for an additional £400 of optional extras (which I didn't need) to be added to my invoice.This is really disgraceful and dishonest, please be mindful of using this company.I've also contacted customerservice at foxrentacar dotcom to escalate this malpractice, but as of yet no meaningful response to my dispute/ complaint.",1,US,2023-08-07,Negative,unfortunately displeasure look dishonest salesperson fox car rental desk orlando fl location basically reserve hire car use rd party site upon arrival fox orlando fl location long day travel canada confirm detail etc part aware ensure get counter sale rep explicitly run whole invoice electronically sign invoiceultimately counter sale rep guy conveniently omit mentioning include optional extras loss damage waiver ldw supplemental liability insurance sli platepass at invoicea sign use electronic screen say write initial screen without explain inadvertently sign additional optional extras do not need add invoicethis really disgraceful dishonest please mindful use companyive also contact customerservice foxrentacar dotcom escalate malpractice yet meaningful response dispute complaint,7,August,2023

"Not sure about the bad reviews. The women at the counter got us in an out fairly quickly. No pressure sales. I think most should do their research before they get there. Like if you are fully covered on your insurance policy you don’t need insurance. But if you don’t have collision, theft etc you need it. Also, you can get fast track for tolls instead of paying fox. It made sense for us because we only went over one toll bridge. If you plan on going over the GGate numerous times then I’d just get it at fox. And fill your tank before you return it. There’s a gas station right down the street. If not don’t complain when they charge you. Do your due diligence.

"Most cars have very high mileage and are usually not very clean at all. I had a reservation for a full-size car, but the rental agent kept trying to make me take a 2 door car. I explained numerous times that I was renting a mobility scooter and also had other people with me which would make a two door car extremely inconvenient. He finally gave me a really dirty 4 door Dodge Charger.

The representative transferred me to the Billing department; I spoke with Maydel and after a long hold, she said I would need to provide a copy of my mother's hospital records in order to get a refund. When I questioned her re: HIPAA, she said it was the company's policy. I then asked to speak to a supervisor. After holding, she returned to the line and said no supervisor was available. I asked to leave a message and have a supervisor return a call to me. The representative said that ""they don't do that"". bottom line: In addition to not being able to speak to a supervisor, it is this company's policy to violate the federal HIPAA laws which are protective of one's healthcare privacy.

Lastly, the interior of the windshield had a haze that I had to clean to see clearly.

They told me they would charge me $20 for each day I returned the car early. So they got $80.00 from me and the ability to rent the car at the much higher last minute rate.

"I had never heard of Fox but decided to give them a try since they were much cheaper than other car rental companies.  The shuttle was there when we arrived and it was a short ride to the Fox location.  The car wasn't ready immediately, but I only waited about 5 minutes until they brought it to me.  There was a little dirt in the back (probably didn't have time to get it fully cleaned) but overall the vehicle was great!

"I don't know... Give me a free low mpg SUV rental (i.e., Mazda CX-5 or Toyota RAV4). The member of staff who served me at pick-up wasn't very patient with me, as I was trying to pull my ID from my wallet, notwithstanding the fact that there was not a line of people behind me. Once I gave her my ID, she shouted my name out. I don't like that. I didn't appreciate that. I don't think that anyone likes that... Privacy is important, especially for me. She became personable when I asked the question about securing a rental car at a lower rate. However, when we walked out to see the ""Manager's Special"" she said that it would be a full-size to mid-size SUV, but she forced me an almost 6'6"" guy to select one of the three Chargers. Charger sits very low and have poor visibility. When I tried to explain that to her, she didn't do anything to help me. She played the negotiation game of ""silence and repeat the previous position or option"". Those experiences don't sit well with me, because it could lead to the spirit of argumentation and confrontation per the disagreement and ultimately rancor. So, the ease of my overall pick-up experience was not so good, it was only good because there was not anyone in line when I walked in. If there was a line or longer, my experience could have been worst as the personalities behind the desk could probably become overwhelmed by the impatience of people waiting in a long line. As stated, I was NOT satisfied with the vehicle I was forced to accept, but I was absolutely satisfied the overall cleanliness of the vehicle. However, there were a number of dents. My experience when returning the vehicle was simple and quick, but I didn't receive a receipt to prove that everything was okay like the audit at the exit was conducted before I left the property with the vehicle. I took the city bus from my hotel to Fox. My experience taking the shuttle bus from Fox to the airport was cool.  The guy was amicable and aired smooth jazz. Thus, if you would like to improve to make my experience a 10, which will convince me to recommend Fox others in my network, then simply give me a free 2-day low mpg SUV rental (i.e., Mazda CX-5 or Toyota RAV4). That would take the bitterness out.",3,US,2023-07-11,Neutral,do not know give free low mpg suv rental ie mazda cx toyota rav member staff serve pickup be not patient try pull i d wallet notwithstanding fact line people behind give I d shouted name do not like do not appreciate do not think anyone like privacy important especially become personable ask question secure rental car low rate however walk see manager special say would fullsize midsize suv force almost guy select one three charger charger sit low poor visibility try explain do not anything help play negotiation game silence repeat previous position option experience do not sit well could lead spirit argumentation confrontation per disagreement ultimately rancor ease overall pickup experience good good anyone line walk line long experience could bad personality behind desk could probably become overwhelmed impatience people wait long line state satisfied vehicle force accept absolutely satisfied overall cleanliness vehicle however number dent experience return vehicle simple quick do not receive receipt prove everything okay like audit exit conduct left property vehicle take city bus hotel fox experience take shuttle bus fox airport cool guy amicable air smooth jazz thus would like improve make experience convince recommend fox other network simply give free day low mpg suv rental ie mazda cx toyota rav would take bitterness,11,July,2023

"I am extremely disappointed with my experience reserving a car rental through Fox. Despite booking in advance through Expedia, the individual at the front desk, Mehdi, not only provided misleading information but also falsely claimed that we were legally required to purchase rental liability insurance in Florida. This unnecessary upselling tactic is completely unacceptable.Furthermore, when we inquired about the plate toll pass and explained our travel plans, Mehdi strongly recommended it, even though we ended up needing it only once. This proves that their recommendations are solely focused on maximizing their profits, rather than providing valuable and honest advice to customers.To make matters worse, upon returning the vehicle, Anthony, the person responsible for inspecting the gas level, assured us that he would mark it as half a tank if we gave a positive review. However, it is evident that he lied, as our final charges indicated that the tank was still recorded as a quarter full. This deceitful behavior is utterly reprehensible.As a result of these deceptive practices, we were forced to pay significantly more than the initial booking through Expedia. I strongly caution others against using this car rental company. Their staff members are untrustworthy, pushy with upselling, and ultimately only interested in wasting customers' hard-earned money.",1,US,2023-07-01,Negative,extremely disappointed experience reserve car rental fox despite book advance expedia individual front desk mehdi provide mislead information also falsely claim legally require purchase rental liability insurance florida unnecessary upselling tactic completely unacceptablefurthermore inquire plate toll pass explain travel plan mehdi strongly recommend even though end need prove recommendation solely focus maximize profit rather provide valuable honest advice customersto make matter bad upon return vehicle anthony person responsible inspect gas level assure we would mark half tank give positive review however evident lie final charge indicate tank still record quarter full deceitful behavior utterly reprehensiblea result deceptive practice force pay significantly initial booking expedia strongly caution other use car rental company staff member untrustworthy pushy upselling ultimately interested waste customer hardearne money,1,July,2023

Fox has great rates for anyone. And the deposit isn't big. The cars are pretty clean and newer. I've rented in Seattle and LA from Fox.

"Horrible car rental company.  We rented a car through the Capital One travel portal for $500, when we picked the car up there was an additional $500 charge.  WTH?I have rented cars for many years in all countries.  This rental service has NO service after 10pm or before 8am!  So because of flight delays we had to get a taxi to the hotel in a different town, then back again the next day.  We called them before they closed telling them of the flight delay, but all they could say is ""too bad, we close at 10pm on the dot"".Likewise our flight out was before 8am but there was no drop off before 8a so we missed our flight.

Manager admitted her employees don't follow the rules but just kept saying I signed for stuff I didn't agree too. Don't ever rent from them please I beg you avoid at all cost.

We were all set and on the highway within less than 30 minutes total. We returned during closed hours and just followed the instructions we were given. Parked the car in designated area. Put keys in the Dropbox. I received a receipt later that day for the exact amount I was told. I rented a Nissan sudan.

"Fox Rent-A-Car at the San Antonio airport attempted to charge me an additional $148.27 (about 25.44% of the total price of the rental) for a “mandatory loss of use” fee at the time I was picking up the vehicle. I said 1) there has been no loss of use as I obviously haven’t been in an accident yet with their vehicle and 2) the credit card I used to book the rental car with, underneath its “Guide to Benefits“ document states, ""The Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver covers theft, damage, ***valid loss-of-use charges imposed and substantiated by the auto rental company***…”. Hence, I did not need to pay their fee. The representative reiterated that it was a mandatory fee and that she would not drop this bogus, unnecessary and undisclosed fee. I spoke with a manager named Clarissa and she falsely stated that no insurance company or credit card covers “loss of use” and this is why they are charging the fee. I said that this is incorrect and to prevent additional arguing, she agreed to waive the fee. Just avoid this company like the plague and if you book through a third party site, notify them that this company is charging unnecessary fees for those who already have coverage for things like ""loss of use."" I might also recommend contacting the state of Texas and FTC/CFPB because if they get enough complaints, they may open up an investigation.",1,US,2023-06-15,Negative,fox rentacar san antonio airport attempt charge additional total price rental mandatory loss use fee time pick vehicle say loss use obviously have not accident yet vehicle credit card use book rental car underneath guide benefit document state auto rental collision damage waiver cover theft damage valid lossofuse charge impose substantiate auto rental company hence need pay fee representative reiterate mandatory fee would drop bogus unnecessary undisclosed fee spoke manager name clarissa falsely state insurance company credit card cover loss use charging fee say incorrect prevent additional arguing agree waive fee avoid company like plague book third party site notify company charge unnecessary fee already coverage thing like loss use might also recommend contact state texas ftccfpb get enough complaint may open investigation,15,June,2023

I had to call Expedia to find out that Europcar owns Fox. Once I found that out I then had to take a shuttle off-site to the Fox location. Once I was at the Fox location, I had to wait about 25-30 minutes to pick up the car because the checkout process per customer takes so long. There were only 3 customers ahead of me. I was happy to see that despite these difficulties the van I rented was ready to go and was the van I booked. The van looked new and was easy to drive. I will say that there was a fishy smell in the van. Also, the tire pressure in one of the tires was low and the warning light for this was on when the van was given to me.

Unfortunately, when I called their customer service number, they only offered me a few dollars as an adjustment for the missing gas. That saved them a bit of money over providing the gas and lost them any chance of me ever renting from them again.

"I rented a car through Fox Rental and quickly learned that although the price seemed reasonable, they'll find a way to get more money from you. The guy behind the desk lied to me and told me the price for gas through Fox was lower than at nearby gas stations. I repeated what he said and asked him to clarify, which he did. Then he asked me if I would pay for gas from them when I returned the car. I agreed. It turned out that they charged me for a full tank of gas (and at a higher rate), even though I returned it with over half of the tank of gas still in it. When I called customer service about it, the lady couldn't understand my words, although I articulated them quite clearly. She eventually said, ""The math is simple!"" and hung up. Lesson learned! I will never do business with them again. Besides, the car was full of dents and scratches, which I rented for business and went to visit a customer.

"All 3 of the Fox staff I interacted with were very friendly and efficient.  Highest marks for them.It would be MUCH better if their shuttle TO airport terminal(s) went DIRECTLY to the terminal(s), instead of only to the main rental car place.  If the airport authority would not charge them ""too much"" more to have the shuttles go directly to terminal(s), I hope they will do so, to significantly improve their Customers' experience.  If the airport authority would charge ""too much"", as a somewhat less-satisfactory alternative, they could greatly increase the frequency of their shuttles to (& perhaps also from) the main rental car place.ALSO:  There need to be at least 2 (more) signs at the main rental car building, to guide arriving customers DIRECTLY to the Fox shuttle pickup location -- one inside the building, near the entrance from the terminal mini-train platform, & another one outside at the shuttle boarding location.   Current LAME signage directs arriving customers to an exit all the way to the far right end of the rental car building,  But then outside, you have to walk (outside) all the way back to the OTHER end of the building, where the actual shuttle pickup point for Fox (at least) is!* * * I could not tell how to adjust the outside rearview mirror positions!!!

We had to buy Clorox wipes to clean before we headed to our destination. Also, there is no way to call location directly. All calls to the SLC location go through a call center which is unfamiliar with the area and just promises to leave a message for the location.

"TERRIBLE! If I could give a negative review, I would!!After waiting in line for over 2 hours to pick up my prepaid car at the Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood airport, I was asked by the worker at the counter if I wanted to return the car with a full tank of gas or have it filled at the airport.

After returning the car, I get an email receipt the next day showing I was charged $3.69/gal plus extra gas fees and other hidden fees. I was also charged for a full tank of gas, even though the car was 3/4 full. When I called billing, I was told  they don't know why I'd be quoted $3/gal and they'd have to call the branch. I  told her  I can provide notarized witness statements. She asked if i still had my contract and asked what it listed as price per gal. I told her it was conveniently left blank. I also told her I have a time and date stamped picture showing the gas guage at 3/4 tank so I can prove it was not returned empty. She said she'd grant me a 1 time courtesy reimbursement of $17. I told her that's not good enough and she was to contact FLL and follow up via email. No follow up was done. I will continue to pursue.

Pre-paid the rental car through RentalCars.com. Turned up at the San Diego RCC to pick up car & presented my valid Canadian driver license. I was told that I needed an International Driver Permit (IDP) to rent the car & the CS rep refused to release the car to me because she told me that I had not read the Fox company terms & conditions. She attempted to cancel the rental but could not. I have read the terms & conditions to confirm that Fox accept a valid Canadian driver license for a rental without an IDP . In 30 years of renting cars in North America & Europe this is the first time I have been refused a rental car due to not having an IDP. RentalCars.com reviewed this case and they informed me that they will issue a refund of my pre-paid rental.,1,CA,2023-04-14,Negative,prepay rental car rentalcarscom turn san diego rcc pick car present valid canadian driver license tell need international driver permit idp rent car cs rep refuse release car tell read fox company term condition attempt cancel rental could read term condition confirm fox accept valid canadian driver license rental without idp year rent car north america europe first time refuse rental car due idp rentalcarscom review case informed issue refund prepay rental,14,April,2023

The only information that was given after I’d paid in full for the car hire to wise cars was the USA company they will hold a security deposit $150 and possibly maybe charged a liability payment..When we arrived to Orlando the company were fox! At first they seemed amazing was so nice……..They were offering all sorts of extras to which I said no, I.E pay for toll roads (we didn’t need) and extra insurance and roadside assistance etc.I was then advised of charges If there was damaged to the car or an accident etc to which I agreed and signed for….baring in mind I’m agreeing to on the condition their is damage!  This worked out around £600 in sterling give or take.Only to find out that after I returned the car they sent a bill charged me for! I will point out no damage or claims were needed the car was fine! I spoke to fox billing team and was basically told tuff you signed for it! No I signed for the costs if there was damage….. this was not how it was advised to me…I made it clear this was not how it was said to me! I was ignored and said you put your Initials and signed for it…..I’m aware of the costs if this is the case then why not take the money?  why hold it??? This was because I was told they will hold the balance incase there is damage, they have even charged me for road assistance and insurance… and bunch of other stuff. After paying wise cars £471 I was not excepting to have pay another £600. I asked wise car for help but was told  to take it up with fox!

"Rented a car 03/28/2023-04/10/2023 Arrived 10pm Sea/TAC airport and could not find shuttle. I called fox and was told to call in the morning. When I finally found a booth they told me this happens all the time everyday. There is only one door number 24 that gets you to your shuttle. I had made sure to get directions from fox before my flight and was told just go outside to the shuttle. No mention of DOOR 24. So an hour later I arrive at the rental terminal and I find FOX. Was not able to get the CRV I reserved so I had to settle for a Camry. Took over 15 minutes to find FOX in the very lowest level which was dark, dirty and hard to navigate. Went to the window which had a man and women inside. I waited a few minutes and finally had to knock on the window to get the attention of the staff. Got my keys and asked how I get out. Was told just drive to the left and follow the signs. Went to the left, no signs. Another 15 minutes to find my way out of that dungeon. Drove into Seattle once and when I got home I received a bill from FOX for $75.50 for tolls. $60.00 was for administrative fees. What is really grating is I only drove the car about 100 miles. They knew I was going into Seattle. Terrible company, terrible service. No way to contact anyone. There is a reason they are way at the bottom of that garage in SEATTLE. At 70 years of age and a world traveler they are by far the worst rental car company I have ever dealt with.

"I booked a rental car via Booking.com for a vehicle at Fox Rent A Car LAX in advance on March 6, 2023 for a planned trip in April to Los Angeles, California.  The reservation indicated I would receive a Jeep Grand Cherokee or similar from April 11-13, 2023 a total cost of $126.86.  I arrived at the Fox Rent A Car LAX location on the afternoon of April 11 and the customer service agent (OLUFEMI), indicated they did not have any Jeep Grand Cherokees and if we wanted an SUV he could put us in a Dodge Durango. He indicated it would be $50 per day, which was only $2 difference from the vehicle I had reserved so I agreed.  He proceeded to discuss insurance to which I asked ""Can't I waive the insurance?"". He motioned negatively and again asked me which insurance I wanted so I did choose one since the agent appeared to indicate that I did not have a choice. When I returned the vehicle, the return agent processed the paperwork and the total was significantly higher than the quoted price. He indicated the vehicle was not $50 a day, but was a considered an upgrade and the cost was an ADDITIONAL $50 per day. He also indicated I would not receive the $150 dollar back as the initial customer service agent indicated i would. The receipt I was provided indicated UPSALE. The insurance and the UPSALE definitely was deceptive practices and ""bait and switch"". I spoke to a manager who was not helpful at all. He indicated the Diurango is an upgrade, although I explained to him that his agent did not explain that and the Booking.com reservation indicated Jeep Grand Cherokee or similar. I do know that the MSRP for the  Jeep Grand Cherokee is significantly greater, so I do not understand why the Durango would be considered an upgrade with a $50 extra fee, pricing the rental for almost $100 per day. Had I been explained about the upgrade, I would have respectfully declined. The manager indicated he could not correct the pricing to honor the Booking.com reservation, all the while speaking condescendingly with a smirk on his face. He proceeded to ask me to prove what I was saying. At this time we had a flight to catch and time was of the essence. He indicated we could follow up with the corporate office and he would place notes on the account. This was the worst experience I have ever had renting a vehicle during vacation. I was lied to from the time I arrived to pick up the vehicle until the time I returned the vehicle. Four different Fox Rent A Car representatives communicated four different inconsistent statements regarding my reservation. I believe deceptive practices were employed to solidify upsale contracts and purchase of unnecessary insurance, as I have full coverage automobile insurance on my primary vehicle. All in all, the experience was horrible and I have nothing positive to say about the experience.

"Arrived at LAX, after a long flight.Had made an online reservation for a rental at Europcar. We didn’t know, or was not made aware, that Fox Rental was operating Europcar. The shuttle from LAX was okay. And that’s about the most positive thing with that experience of renting a car at Fox/Europcar. The staff was the most least interested staff, and we were the only costumer in there. The staff were having conversations amongst them and totally ignoring our presence. Finally getting waved to the counter, being met by a woman that obviously didn’t want to be working on a Sunday, didn’t think that a friendly approach was a part of being in the service industry. If we weren’t experienced in renting cars abroad even though we were tired, we could have ended up paying $ 400 more than the actually cost. The woman at the counter tried to convince us to pay extra on insurance, toll etc. she even got very annoyed, because we were insisting on getting that deal that we actually had made an reservation for, online. Finally we got her “approval “ and the papers, and went to pick up a class c car - that wasn’t there. A helpful person in the pick up area got a car that was in the clean up area. Mileage was 55.000, it wasn’t very clean inside, lots of scratches and marks on the outside, and very low tire pressure- well, I suppose that’s the standard nowadays!?  we spend almost 1 hour at this Fox rental LAX which could have been a smooth and easy process.

"I made a reservation to pick up a car through Fox car rental at the Miami airport for 12:30 a.m. The website indicated shuttles were available at that time and the location closed at 12:59 a.m.After my flight arrived right after midnight, not only were there no shuttles available, the location had closed before the said time. My family and I had to wait at the airport for over 5 hours before the location reopened. It also indicated the shuttle service resumed at 5:00 a.m. We waited until 5:30 at the airport and ultimately had to Uber to pick up our car.Mohammed checked us in… I explained what happened and his only explanation was “our hours/shuttle service has changed since covid” Also, if we arrived any later, our reservations would have been cancelled and the car would have been rebooked because they were low on inventory. I said I had already prepaid for the car and he said it didn’t matter because I booked through a third party.I inquired about adding my husband as an additional driver. Mohammed told me if I wanted to add my husband, it would be an additional $20.00 per day. I asked if spouses were included without a charge and he said no…. $20.00 per day. So I left without adding him.I also asked about returning the vehicle in the morning instead of noon because our flight was first thing in the morning. I was told if I returned the car earlier I would be charged $50.76 to return the vehicle 6 hours before.Soon after we left, I noticed the engine light was on and the drive itself was worrisome. The car engine was extremely loud, turbulent ride, couldn’t speed over 70 miles per hour without the engine shaking/rattling and the windshield wipers streaked. It was an extremely dangerous vehicle to drive.The following morning I contacted customer service about switching cars. I had to drive an hour each way to The Fort Meyers location and the customer service was absolutely amazing there… extremely professional! They put me in a different vehicle.I was curious about the additional driver so I read the terms and conditions on Fox’s website. It indicates spouses are eligible as an additional driver without an additional fee, so yet again, I had to drive an hour each way to the Fort Meyers airport to add my husband to the policy.I don’t understand why Mohammed was so rude, unprofessional and why he blatantly lied to me with incorrect information. He also charged me with several miscellaneous small charges that were not included on my initial reservation. Such an unprofessional person to represent the company.

"AVOID AT ALL COSTS -- THEY WILL LEAVE YOU HIGH AND DRY AND NOT GIVE A DAMN. I used an online service to book a car with Fox in San Antonio. I am a US citizen, but I have lived in Mexico for 18 years. I have a US passport and a Mexican driver's license. I am also a permanent resident (green card holder). This has never been an issue in the past. My husband and I were traveling to the US to renew my military ID card (retiree) and to take him to a doctor due to some very serious, and very worrying, medical conditions. Without going into great detail, his health is poor and he can only walk short distances. He required a wheelchair when we were traveling. So, with great difficulty, we get to the Fox counter to do the paperwork for my rental. Right before we got there, we saw another set of people leaving, quite upset. Not wanting to be rude, we didn't listen, but it was clear something wasn't right. I get to the counter and my first impression was that the woman would rather have been filing her nails than deal with a customer. She made it clear that I was a nuisance. No ""Good afternoon"" or ""How can I help you?"" No, instead she just glared at me to see what I wanted. Yes, my back was up by that point. Was I rude then? No. I just smiled and said I had a reservation in the name of ""Me."" She didn't ask, she demanded my driver's license. I handed it to her and explained it was Mexican but I'm a US citizen. She ignored that and demanded (yes, demanded, she was not professional and was a very poor representative of the company) my passport. I gave it to her. She immediately said that I couldn't rent a car because MY PASSPORT AND DRIVER'S LICENSE HAD TO BE FROM THE SAME COUNTRY and that it was in the Expedia agreement and on their website. Um, no, it's not. Unfortunately, I didn't have that info at the time, but I did go back afterward to Expedia and this is what it actually says:   QUOTE    The driver must present a valid driver's license and credit card in their name upon pick-up. The credit card is required as a deposit when renting any vehicle. The deposit amount is held by the car rental company. Please ensure sufficient funds are available on the card.International rentals may have different driver's license requirements. An international driving license is required if the driver's license is non-roman alphabet.  UNQUOTE  Nowhere does it say that the driver's license must match the passport...and might I point out that Mexico uses the same alphabet, i.e., Roman, as the United States. I went to the actual Fox website and pulled up the restrictions for Texas. They say:  QUOTE: Fox Rent A Car, Inc. will only accept US domestic Drivers Licenses when renting any Jeep Wrangler. This includes EFAR (2-door Wrangler), XFAR (4-door Wrangler), and XRAR (Sahara). This applies at locations in Arizona, Texas and Southern California.Please see the PAYMENT Policy for complete drivers license requirements and rental qualifications.  UNQUOTEI even tried to show her my green card to prove I had valid Mexican residency. She barely looked at it or me. By that point, I admit I was steaming. No, I didn't curse her out but I did rant about how the webpage didn't have anything like that. Hubby was also pretty upset and made some comments but again, we did not curse; we did comment on the inanity of this policy (clearly made up). I had been up since midnight. I was tired, my husband could barely walk and this ""representative"" of the agency couldn't have given less of a toss if she had tried. If this is what Fox wants to represent them, then they deserve to go bankrupt. I also noticed that those of us who got turned away were white and Mexican -- the two pilots of our plane got turned away, too! I guarantee their passports matched  their drivers' licenses and they definitely had cars available since ours was now up for grabs!Ending:  I was desperate. I went over to the agency right next door and pled my case to the gentleman working there. He was GREAT. He had no issue with my license and had a car available. It was more expensive, but I didn't care. I was signed up and out within 15 minutes. Since I can't mention their name here, I will just say that it involves a ""t"" added to the number after five.

"DO NOT EVER RENT FROM THEM.  I recently rented a car from them and was asked if I wanted the toll-pass for 12.99.  It was 12.99 a day!  Also was asked if I wanted insurance and I told (name) multiple times no I already purchased insurance I do not want it.  I got a charge of 247 and I was told that was the security deposit for the car and I would only be charged 12.99 once I return the car.  None of it was a security deposit it was the charge for the 12.99 toll-pass a day and the insurance per day.  After trying to receive a refund for the insurance charge because I specifically told him no, I do not want it the company would only refund 50% of the money.  The toll pass I took blame thinking something was only 12.99 even though I was told once I return the car 12.99 is all that would be charged to my account and the remainder was the security deposit.  To make it all better the car was horrible! When I say horrible, my fiancé was worried about us breaking down on our one trip from clearwater to Orlando.  I told myself well you get what you pay, I paid a lower amount so I get a horrible car, but with the extra charges I have been charged that I said I didn't want I could have just gotten a better car from a real rental company.

"If I could give them one star, I would. Absolutely horrible experience from star to finish. First of all, they had a booth at the airport just outside, and was  hard to find. Secondly, the agents working there were absolutely clueless and had no clue what they were doing. They couldn’t find the car and were clicking around to see which car it is, then they gave us a car that wasn’t even cleaned. When we got in we saw the center console was filthy. The guy reached over my aunt to clean it after the fact. Once we reached home we realized we had double paid for insurance, which we paid through Expedia (where we did the original booking). When I called the company to confirm this the agent who answered was very rude, he basically told me to go back and get it refunded when I told him I couldn’t do that he said well there’s nothing we can do. One we reached our destination the operations manager emailed us with a 10% discount and gave us the wrong license plate as the car we rented. Apparently the agents gave us the incorrect car; and marked the car we actually had as returned!! So he was reaching out once he realized the mistake. We were annoyed by this point and how this was all handled, once we finally got to the rental place. They told my aunt who we added as an additional driver there was no record of her being added yet they scanned her license at the time of the rental AND charged us an additional driver fee. The manager was completely rude and dismissive the entire time and even said they had no record of my Call even though the agent had to speak with my husband to get me authorized to speak to!

I verbally declined the excess insurance but it was added by the customer service agent but I did not notice this until I checked the rental agreement at our apartment.  Too late to do anything about it!

"Our reservation was placed in December for a rental SUV from Mar 4-11th in Denver.  When we arrived at our expected pick up time.  The wait at the airport was pretty lengthy as we had to wait for a 2nd shuttle bus because the first one could not accommodate our family of 5. When we arrived, our SUV was not available, and we were told we could wait an hour to see if the vehicle would arrive (but not guaranteed) or we could upgrade to the minivan for an extra $350 on top of the $416 we already paid.  We were stuck because we had prepaid the rental from Priceline, and we were traveling with 3 children with no other rental company next door.  I've never experienced this before in all the years I have rented vehicles on vacation.  Usually, we are given another vehicle of equal or better value due to ""overbooking"" on the company's end.  Anyhow, I struggled with the decision on what to do, and then another group came in with a similar situation with a really heated argument that took place.  I don't know if this is a common tactic for this company, but it's not a good look.  Finally, the manager (Marie) came back after dealing with the other party and dropped the upgrade fee to half.  It still was not ok with me to have to pay for any additional fee but reluctantly did so because we really had no other choice.

"It's Fox Rent-A-Car at LAX. What are you expecting? You are paying less money than pretty much every other Car Rental place. It's a good deal. We regularly rent cars from them. We know what to expect and have never had an issue with them. Yes, they try to upsell you and get you to buy insurance, prepay for gas, etc. Whatever. That's what these companies do! And it's helpful for some people. What blew us away on our most recent trip was when our 6 year old left a backpack in a rental car that we were thinking about choosing, but then we chose another vehicle. Several hours down the road, we realized that the backpack was missing - probably left in a different vehicle - with his tablet and other items that are very precious to a 6-year old boy.Assuming the worst, that someone had probably taken it, and had already pawned everything off, we still called Fox to see if they could check the other cars and see if by chance, the backpack was still there. I initially spoke with a person who was at a call center and unable to connect me directly to the LAX Fox, (which was annoying,) but she took my information and phone number down. Shortly after I got a call from the Fox LAX manager who told me that they went out and FOUND kiddo's backpack! And that they would hold onto it for when we returned. A week later, when we returned, we were handed the backpack with everything intact. Really appreciated them doing this for us! Saved the day and several hundred dollars for us. Did not expect anyone there to bother to help us out, but they came through!

"As an under 25 traveler, I was looking for a place that would be - as they say on their site - hassle free. It was not. Long story short, I was overcharged hundreds of dollars.Good things first: the person who helped me at the desk was very friendly. When the vehicle reserved for me was unavailable (more on that later), she was quick to give me options. When the second vehicle had problems, she was quick to offer a replacement. Once I was behind the wheel of the third and final vehicle, things went smoothly. The return was painless and quick.The bad things break down into a couple of categories. We'll start with car troubles. As mentioned above, the first vehicle, a Jeep Wrangler well suited for driving in the mountains right after a big snow, was for some reason unavailable (they blamed the flight delay throwing off my arrival time). When I pressed, I was told there was a 30 minute wait while they did some kind of work on it. Okay, long travel day, we just want to get home, so what else is there that we don't have to wait for? A small AWD SUV. Sure, good enough. Sign the paperwork, my group and I pile our stuff in, and we head out. On the road, I notice that the engine RPMs are consistently in the 4-6k range; the engine is complaining loudly once we hit anything above 45mph. Some 10 minutes out from Fox, we turn back.Also as mentioned above, they are quick to offer a replacement - but not before the manager asks to test the vehicle himself. I understood the need to verify but was also annoyed, because it felt as though he didn't trust me or anyone in my group to accurately report when an engine is nearly redlining trying to go from 50 to 55mph. When he got back from his test drive ""on an empty road out back"" (paraphrasing), he reported no issues. Cool, I still don't feel safe in that vehicle. What about the Jeep? It's been almost half an hour at this point, we'll just use that. Alas, the Jeep is now completely unavailable. With the benefit of hindsight, I suspect it was never available at all.We end up with a 4runner that is, quite honestly, just fine, though it struggled mightily going up in the mountains. The next category, additional charges, is why I will warn any and all drivers away from Fox, especially if they are under 25 or new to renting a vehicle like I was.The nice woman at the front desk was, again, nice. But she was also - to be diplomatic - misrepresenting the truth. The advance estimate for the total cost was about $530, but on the day, the cost was about $930. I'd understand a bit of fluctuation but not nearly double the initial estimate. This massive increase of course had me hesitate, but the nice woman at the front desk assured me that ""most"" of that increase was a security deposit that would be refunded upon vehicle return. A more experienced individual would have asked, at this point, why that substantial cost was not included in the initial estimate and have her point out where on the invoice that security deposit was listed. I failed to do either of those things, naively trusting the nice woman behind the desk because I was tired, stressed, and out of my element with three other people in my group waiting on me.$100 of the increase was from the underage fee. Heaven only knows why they don't include that in the estimate when they know the age of the driver in advance.When I finally noticed and balked at the added (supposedly optional) $130 insurance charge - I had my own insurance - she very nicely informed me that the optional insurance was required for underage renters. I pushed her on this, asked where in the agreement it was, and she deflected by saying it was a legal requirement. The car troubles and very long travel day distracted me enough that I failed to get that fun fact down in writing.There was no security deposit. There was, upon a reread of the policies listed in the email days after the fact, no optional insurance requirement for underage renters who had insurance of their own. Hundreds of dollars, gone, because I wasn't smart enough to see that I was getting played.",1,US,2023-01-18,Negative,traveler look place would say site hassle free long story short overcharge hundred dollarsgood thing first person help desk friendly vehicle reserve unavailable later quick give option second vehicle problem quick offer replacement behind wheel third final vehicle thing go smoothly return painless quickthe bad thing break couple category well start car trouble mention first vehicle jeep wrangler well suited drive mountain right big snow reason unavailable blame flight delay throw arrival time press tell minute wait kind work okay long travel day want get home else do not wait small awd suv sure good enough sign paperwork group pile stuff head road notice engine rpm consistently k range engine complain loudly hit anything mph minute fox turn backalso mention quick offer replacement manager ask test vehicle understand need verify also annoy feel though do not trust anyone group accurately report engine nearly redline try go mph get back test drive empty road back paraphrasing report issue cool still do not feel safe vehicle jeep almost half hour point well use ala jeep completely unavailable benefit hindsight suspect never available allwe end runner quite honestly fine though struggle mightily go mountain next category additional charge warn driver away fox especially new renting vehicle like wasthe nice woman front desk nice also diplomatic misrepresenting truth advance estimate total cost day cost I d understand bit fluctuation nearly double initial estimate massive increase course hesitate nice woman front desk assure increase security deposit would refund upon vehicle return experience individual would ask point substantial cost include initial estimate point invoice security deposit list fail either thing naively trust nice woman behind desk tired stress element three people group wait increase underage fee heaven know do not include estimate know age driver advancewhen finally notice balk add supposedly optional insurance charge insurance nicely inform optional insurance require underage renter push ask agreement deflect say legal requirement car trouble long travel day distract enough fail get fun fact writingthere security deposit upon reread policy list email day fact optional insurance requirement underage renter insurance hundred dollar go be not smart enough see getting play,18,January,2023

"We rented our car from the Fox location in Costa Mesa, CA.  Jackie was the agent who we worked with.  She has a wonderful personality: very friendly, professional and very helpful in providing directions.  When we returned our car three weeks later, we needed to order a LYFT car to bring us back to our residence. We could not access the internet on our phone, and the agent (not Jackie) told us that Fox did not provide WiFi--YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME, we said to the agent.  He shrugged his shoulders and said the company didn't provide it (Fox: get WiFi for your customers!) He offered no help. We then saw Jackie and went to her for help.  She was TERRIFIC!  She connected us to her personal phone's Hotspot so that we could access the LYFT app.  She did all this with a smile on her face--she sincerely wanted to help us.  We hope that Fox has an employee recognition program (if not, please develop one).  Jackie is the reason that we will use Fox again. She deserves to be recognized for her wonderful service.

Scam artists. Be aware. Declined additional insurance and in fact had to prove I had insurance. Told me I was signing to decline the insurance on a debit sized screen. 23 days after our rental we received an email copy of the agreement that looks nothing like what we signed. Shows an additional $200USD for insurance on a 1 week rental. No way to tell it wasn’t declined Fox sent us a form that was not the form we signed claiming we signed it. My business partners “prepaid fuel” also went from $3.30/gallon to $8.99/gallon on his forms. These guys are scam artists so be aware. Say they will refund the month in fox rental credit but I would never rent from them again with fear of this occurring again.

"BOOKING ID 46M7F9 @ Denver 2/16/22. Going skiing booked SUV, Chicago had a blizzard plain delayed 1 hr. Turns out no SUV available , at 7 pm so I was offered sedan or nothing. I still had 4 hr drive to mountains. 7pm on the airport not too many options available on holiday Weeknd. Had to squeeze kids and long skies after unpacking bags on the sidewalk. I was told they hold a car 1 hrs and I should call being delays on the plain?! I wasn't only one in line to be denied SUV. In front of me 2 other groups had the same experience being refused SUV. It was all happening, while we are  under nice advertisement with Toyta 4 runner saying how one can be upgraded to better experience. Who? Which one? I even didn’t want the upgrade I just wanted my regular experience with SUV. Shrewdness bothered me. They know upfront they what they going to do, thats why SUV rental is cheap. Probably few get it. And the rest of  you have sedan that is overpriced. They didn’t want to adjust the price because I was downgraded (though offered free tank of gas). This is first time I used other company then Enterprise. Before covid when enterprise didn’t have a car they would give free upgrade. If downgraded would always nicely adjusted a price.

The phone representative said that it could take 30 minutes if the bus was delayed. I was on the south curb outside Terminal 4 as instructed, and was told to wait. When the taxi dispatcher asked me if I wanted a taxi, and I explained my situation, he said to follow the signage to the rental car center via the sky train.

"ABSOLUTE FRAUD ON EVERY LEVEL!    AVOID THIS COMPANY!   Reserved an SUV thru Priceline.  Paid approx. $200 for 3 days in Seattle.  Upon pick-up, I was asked if I would like to take advantage of a service they provide for my convenience:  Since the fuel tank is full now and I am supposed to return it with the same, instead I can just drop off the vehicle, they will replace the missing fuel and charge me $4.46 a gallon.  I was told in the Seattle area the average price was around $5/gallon.   Sounds great, right????   Don't have to stop at a gas station before returning the car and save a few dollars as well.  I ended up driving fewer miles than expected and returned the vehicle with the tank still 7/8 full.  Upon returning home, I found out that Fox charged me an additional $252 dollars, including $90 for an upgrade I didn't ask for and $102.58 for fuel.  I did the math:  $102.58 divided by $4.46 per gallon comes to 23 gallons.  The Toyota 4runner I had holds exactly 23 gallons of fuel.  So they charged me as if I returned the SUV without a drop of fuel in it.  Naturally, I called customer service.  Someone in the Philippines answered the phone and I could hear farm animals in the background.   Never a great sign!   They proceeded to tell me that I did in fact return the car with 7/8 full of gas, but unfortunately, nothing could be done since I signed a contract stating I would pay $102.58 for gas.  I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told someone would call within 24-48 hours. Of course, no one did.   I tried to call the Fox rental desk at Seattle airport directly.   BEWARE!!!  Any automated option you choose will end up being answered by someone in the Philippines.  I even tried to dispute the credit card transaction thru my bank to see if I could get the fraudulent charges returned.  The result was the same:  Too bad, the contract has your signature.

These rental offerings are usually made by fly-by-night rental shops close to the airport on Century Blvd. After waiting for shuttles that seldom arrive, after calling customer service numbers that send you to an agent on another planet who just tell you, “the shuttle is on the way” you finally get to the off-site location and then dragged through small print that usually traps you into additional charges or just makes your life miserable as you try to get the vehicle you were promised, an experience where you WISH you had paid more for another rental carrier.  FOX IS DIFFERENT, Fox has lots of nice vehicles of every type, they really do.  Sometimes the wait at the counter has been a tiny bit long, but overall, the people are very nice, and you really get a great deal and are treated like you are working with a major rental car company at a bargain rate who VALUES your business.  Hopefully, Europcar keeps up the great work and Fox continues to grow, as long as the folks are nice, I’ll keep coming back – thanks!",4,CA,2023-02-10,Positive,fox rent car change great way acquisition europcar take fox small offer century blvd major company approach great vehicle great price people arrive lax search los angeles rental car web first listing usually much cheap rental offering usually make flybynight rental shop close airport century blvd waiting shuttle seldom arrive call customer service number send agent another planet tell shuttle way finally get offsite location drag small print usually trap additional charge make life miserable try get vehicle promise experience wish pay another rental carrier fox different fox lot nice vehicle every type really sometimes wait counter tiny bit long overall people nice really get great deal treat like work major rental car company bargain rate value business hopefully europcar keep great work fox continue grow long folk nice ill keep come back thank,10,February,2023

However many of the vehicles are older with high miles and in pretty tough condition (ours had 80k+ miles and a battery that struggled to start the car every day).

Inspect the car very carefully including windshield wiper functionality and windshield chips before taking the vehicle.

I did double-check with my personal insurance to make sure I'd be covered in case of an accident, and printed out all my documents so I was prepared.  The vehicle provided was a lot larger than expected (I reserved a compact SUV and received a huge Toyota 4Runner) - but I would much prefer this than the other way around.

"Twice in a row the San Diego Fox Rental Car location either ""did not have"" or cancelled my reservation with no notice. The first time they said they just did not have it and blamed it on Priceline, who verified they sent the reservation, and even re-confirmed while I was there waiting. The next time I booked directly with Fox and for some reason nobody could explain to me why they cancelled it with no notice. I was renting a minivan for my family and they told me they didn't have any minivans available but I could have a huge SUV for more than double the price. I told them I did not want a huge SUV and would go elsewhere to find a van. Two minutes later they magically had 6 or 7 minivans to choose from but at a 50% higher cost than my reservation. Since it was almost 11 PM and my wife and 14 month old were waiting, I took what I could get. Lastly, they told me I didn't need to fill up the tank when I returned the vehicle and that gas would be billed at $4.40/gallon.

The car was decent for a rental. The shuttles were quick and drivers courteous. The clerk at the counter was trained well to get people to purchase their toll package.

"Got the typical bate & switch.  Had even called to confirm a Hyundai Santa Fe was available as wanted to test drive this model after getting it last year from FOX in Ft Lauderdale and was happy with it.  But was offered only a Dodge Journey which is NOT EQUIVALENT as these vehicles don't have the necessary leg room as does the Santa Fe...why even classify as same?  So the typical response was ""we can upgrade you""...OF COURSE...IT'LL COST YOU!!!  WHY???? I was promised it and why I PREPAID!!!! WHAT a typical SCAM!!!   The vehicle I was given was NOT AN UPGRADE....it was the typical Jap tin can!!...a sub-standard Toyota 4Runner...no featured equipment features like the normal Hyundai Santa Fe and drove and handled TERRIBLE!!!  It even was reporting tire issues CONSTANTLY...but all tires fine...didn't even have way to test tire inflation pressure like most GMCs have...again substandard.  Why if FOX didn't have the promised vehicle...upgrade at THEIR EXPENSE?  And if I pay almost double the daily rate I was promised...TRULY upgrade to a vehicle with same features as promised...not these sub-standard Toyotas, but at least a GMC equivalent?  It'll be my last rental from FOX!!  I had to put up with this crap vehicle for 3weeks!! FOX knew I was coming nearly 3 months ahead and prepaid as well...I would had expected FOX to ensure that the vehicle promised WAS AVAILABLE and reserved...especially having been a repeat /returning customer.   Oh and by-the-way...STOP encouraging buying the toll road SunPass @ $10 a day...the desk clerk said oh you'll need it!!...BS!!! Drove nearly 1000 miles and NEVER NEEDED IT.

"I rented a vehicle (Nissan Altima) from Fox. I was told to bring the car back empty (as in no gas in the tank) and prepay a full tank of gas because their gas rates are cheaper.  I informed the lady I was not driving that many miles and would not be able to use all the gas in it, and would bring it back full, and she said, why do that, our rates are cheaper and we will only charge you for what you use.  That was a LIE!!  I only used a quarter of a tank, and upon return, I got a $47.54 charge on my credit card.  They informed me that I prepaid for a half tank of gas, and I said I only used a quarter tank, and all they could say was, this is a valid charge, Sir.  There was also a separate charge for $18.86 for an ""early return"".  The car had to be returned by 12pm, and I returned it at 9:30AM that morning.  Does that really warrant an early return charge?  Seriously??  Clearly, this is a nickel and dime operation that chooses to rip off their customers (and be dishonest with them) in order to add a few more bucks to their bottom line.  Very dishonorable  and they lack integrity as a Company.  Do not trust these people.  I will never use them again, and will not recommend them to anyone.

"We have been scammed by Europcar by Keddy (also under the name Fox Rentals) at the Cancun airport .  We arrived at the airport and after 1 hour no shuttle arrived for us.  The telephone at the rental car company did not answer the phone. The Europcar desk told us to wait outside for a shuttle. After 1 hour we re-enter the airport to find a man at the desk Europcar desk whom calls us a shuttle which arrives with a Europcar and Fox rental logo.  This shuttle takes us to a trailer with a Fox Rental logo on the representatives shirts.  After waiting in a parking area we enter the trailer. The Fox rental representative immediately refuses our rentalcover insurance booked with booking.com as they say it does not work in Mexico. They then tell us to show them our American Express (AMEX)  proof of insurance. I sent the document to the email provided by the representative after calling American Express long distance 20 minute phone call .  They ask me to sign electronically on an iPad and ask for my credit card American Express.  I sign and give them my credit card.  They tell me I must leave a 9.000 Dollar security deposit.   Then they told me the mexican law requires a licence fee of 140,00  dollars.  Then the manager comes  and informs me that  the American express insurance is not accepted in Mexico (contrary of the 1st representative).  He also tells me I must cancel the rental cover insurance as it is not valid.My husband contacts rental cover.com whom tells us this information is not true.  We look up this Fox rentals on the internet and discover they are a scam.   We were in the office for a total of 2 hours . Plus 1.5 hours waiting for a shuttle.  We left the trailer office with no car.  The representatives were very unprofessional and aggressive.   We walked out and went to Carflex next door whom told us it is not true concerning the fees.   They wasted our time for 3 hours and wasted our money on long distance calls to Booking, rental cover and American Express (over 100 Euros of charges)    We spend over 100 Euros of long distance phone calls to American express, rentalcover and booking.com.

I informed them that their reply was urgent as I needed a rental vehicle the following day, I did not hear from them so I requested a full refund of £842.98 which I paid in full to them 3 months early and then had to find another rental vehicle myself.

"DO NOT RENT FROM THIS AGENCY. I had a terrible experience renting from Fox, also referred to as Europcar. The information in my reservation said a shuttle would be available to and from the Orlando, FL airport from and to the car park; however, when we arrived to return the car, the rental office and lot were closed and we had to leave the car parked literally outside on the street, leave the keys with a security guard and hire our own transportation to the airport. This all caused a delay, terrible stress as well as an extra expenditure. Several other customers found themselves in the same difficulty. It was all very upsetting. Apart from that, I stated I did not want any extra coverage and only wanted what I had already paid for, the agent said there was nothing extra and had me sign on a screen the agreement. Upon receiving my receipt, it turns out I was charged for extras that were not clearly stated as extras. The cost of the rental may appear to be cheaper than in other agencies, but in the end it turns out more expensive with the “sneaky” extras and it’s not worth it if you’re left stranded without a way of getting to the airport.

"As this was the first time using FOX (I normally rent from the bigger, more mainstream rental brands), I paid close attention to the process and nuances.  First of all, the line at FOX was far shorter than the other car rental counters at the Phoenix airport.  This is perhaps likely due to Fox not marketing their cars on the big discount sites like Hotwire, etc.  (perhaps that helps them keep costs down in order to offer lower costs rentals).  The rental process was quick and the only small frustration was the $12+ fee for an extra driver (my wife).  I understand that rental car companies need to make money, but fees like this seem completely excessive and unnecessary (**if the renter (or his / her insurance) pays for damage to the car no matter what, how can a rental agency justify an extra driver fee other than to simply extract more money from the renter?  how does an extra driver incur more costs to the rental agency?).   The representative (Trish) was very nice and just was doing her job - I understand this.  But, it does seem obvious that the agents are given incentives to upsell / cross sell additional fees to every customer, which is annoying). To offset the extra driver fee, she offered a car upgrade to a 4Runner, which softened the blow to some extent but the $300 or so more for the 'added driver' definitely soured the process.  Downstairs, we were greeted by Breann Sellers who helped us find our vehicle. She was LOVELY and a pleasure (and made getting the car very pleasant).  A couple other observations:  we rented the car for 25 days and decided to return the car early (after 15 days).  Upon reading the rental agreement and searching online, it was very unclear what Fox's 'early return' policy was.  I finally reached somebody at billing who was confused and could hardly explain the policy to me (it sounded like a Filipino call center with somebody hardly fluent in the rental car process).  This was baffling to me since early returns seem like a VERY common practice for rental car companies.  After trying to interpret the billing representative's explanation of the early return policy, I decided to attempt to return the car early figuring that I'd keep the car if the return fee was onerous.  Upon returning the car, the representative (ALI, who was very nice) explained that I'd need to go to the check-in counter upstairs to discuss the early return fees / policy and that he could only charge the auto-fee / daily rate penalty (which I didn't know about and that the billing department could not explain clearly).  Thankfully, I had time to go upstairs, wait in the short line and discuss the early return matter (as it paid off).  The manager, Joelle, was so nice and thoughtful and made the manual / override adjustments to the billing to prorate my rental agreement (paying for the days I had the car, waiving the penalties).  Joelle - thank you so much for the kind help and objectivity regarding the circumstances.  She and her team at the Phoenix airport were excellent.  We were happy to pay for the car and expected that returning a car early would not incur expensive penalties.  Summary:  I've rented cars dozens of times and, after finding Fox, would certainly rent again, with some caveats.  Pros:  short lines, nice people, low costs, decent car options -- Cons:  unclear and unusual policies and possible excessive penalties and add-ons (not standard car rental policies) that can turn what is supposed to be a discount provider into an expensive option.  Just be sure you read the fine print and ask questions.

"While the staff was awesome, check in was very fast, and our van was very nice, the one thing that knocked a star off was the double shuttle riding.  From the airport you take one shuttle to another area that you then wait in another line to get to the rental area.  Since it's the beginning of a trip, we didn't mind that.  The return trip of doing the Fox shuttle to the airport shuttle became very stressful when there was now huge lines to try and catch a bus to the airport (this was at 4:30 am).  A direct shuttle would have been a lot less stressful.  Overall, knowing ahead of time that it could take 40 mins to get to the Vegas airport (even though you are only a few miles from it) should help others plan accordingly.

Don't ever rent from this company. Was charged 60.00 administrative fees for 5.05 worth of tolls. These fees were not disclosed at signing but were said to be buried in the fine print.

Just look at all the negative reviews this company is getting. While we are at it The first car I was given pulled to the right tremendously so I took it back.

Especially if you are foreign, seems to be their favourite victims even if my english is fairly good. Here is our story and my reasons I recommend you to to choose any other company instead of Fox:1. We booked a car with place for 3 suitcases in the back (according to the website). Arriving at Fox garage the lady who helps us says they don't have that typ of a car in, but shows us another car she says is the same size, which after reading about the different models is NOT. There is no way for us to fit our two toddlers and our bags safely in the car she shows us and she offers us to upgrade to a bigger one, we have no choice to say other than yes. should cost us +580 USD.1""tollpass is included in your booking so you just drive past the tolls ok?"" sure thing! Both me and my husband were happy because usually renting in the US that is a question(!) of upgrade while picking up the car. But..Afterwords she charged us for it. Now looking at the reciept it do say 11.56USD/day but when she said its INCLUDED IN THE BOOKING the tired, jetlagged mom with two crying kids did not reflect more on that. I guess the lady at the counter notice my state of mind and saw her shot to make some more money, both with the toll pass and the upgrade. 3. We rented a GPS. the GPS did not come with any kind of holder and I need to try to drive with it in my lap. But it did not really matter because we notice quick it did not work. ""Connection lost. searching...."" It sent us on so many detours because it could not keep up with the highway and where to get of so we stoped using it after a day or two and used our phones (with roaming) instead. ""it should be working"" was the only thing the guy said at return when I wanted my money back. So DO NOT rent via Fox in Miami or Europcar via Booking.com in Miami, and IF you do. make sure you read all three pages because what the people working at Fox says and what is written is not always the same.",1,US,2022-12-02,Negative,would never recommend anyone rent car via fox rent car miami airport case via thought would safe non bluff company europcar bookingcom aperently deliver shady fox especially foreign seem favourite victim even english fairly good story reason recommend choose company instead fox book car place suitcase back accord website arrive fox garage lady help we say do not typ car show we another car say size read different model way we fit two toddler bag safely car show we offer we upgrade big one choice say yes cost we usdtollpass include booking drive past toll ok sure thing husband happy usually rent we question upgrade pick car butafterword charge we look reciept say usdday say include booking tired jetlagged mom two cry kid reflect guess lady counter notice state mind see shot make money toll pass upgrade rent gps gps come kind holder need try drive lap really matter notice quick work connection lose searching send we many detour could keep highway get stop use day two use phone roam instead work thing guy say return want money back rent via fox miami europcar via bookingcom miami make sure read three page people work fox say write always,2,December,2022

However, reading their website now under the small text of the section ""Am I required to take the insurance?"" their answer is very clear: ""No, the purchase of Optional Insurance is not required to rent a vehicle.""...

I feel like if they have not trained their employees the right way is NOT my fault you can’t tell someone one thing and then do something else when it’s a company……. What kind of customer service is this? What kind of company don’t try to satisfy their customers? If the agent would have said it’s nothing they could do I would have did something different and then to charge me 1 whole day for one hour is just not fair. DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY.

"I had a car reservation at Sky Harbor this past March through a travel website for about $550.  I mistakenly put the reservation in my wife's name.  When I got there, Fox refused to switch the reservation to my name or book me at the $550 rate.  They offered to book me at $2,500.  Okay, that is their prerogative and I made a mistake in the booking.  However, they could have earned my unending loyalty by giving me a booking in my name at the rate of the original reservation of $550.  This tells me that Fox is more interested in short-term gain then in building customer loyalty.  That is their right.  It is my right to walk, as I did (over to another rental agency).

"STOP STOP STOPDO NOT USE THIS COMPANYMy wife and I had waited 3 years to visit our family after the COVID lock downAfter a long 11 hour flight we landed in L.A and arrived at the Fox rental depot.Very weary from the flight I initially thought I had lost my credit card needed to complete the rental agreement, I then realized I had forgotten the pin number of the card and to make things even worse my cell phone would not work on any of the local networks making it impossible to contact my bank for assistance, at this point myself and my wife who also has health issues were getting very stressed.The agent we spoke with offered his phone to use as a hot spot so I could access the internet and use my phone banking service, We chatted away gradually feeling more relaxed, it then came to the options regarding insurance etc and as a regular travelers before lock down we were comfortable without the extra charges and explained that to the agent, he quickly printed out the paperwork for us and crossed on the lines for us to sign.Unfortunately this is were I came unstuck, because we were on semi-friendly terms I didn't bother to read the small print and it wasn't until I got home and received my credit card statement I saw I had been charged more than double to what I had expected. being both senior citizens this was a most unwelcome surprise especially when being on a limited budget.I understand now not to trust anyone now and to always read the small print before signing.In future if we are able to visit the USA I will certainly not be using FOX car rentals.BEWARE",1,Other,2022-08-29,Negative,stop stop stopdo use companymy wife wait year visit family covid lock downafter long hour flight land la arrive fox rental depotvery weary flight initially think lose credit card need complete rental agreement realize forget pin number card make thing even bad cell phone would work local network make impossible contact bank assistance point wife also health issue get stressedthe agent speak offer phone use hot spot could access internet use phone banking service chat away gradually feel relaxed came option regard insurance etc regular traveler lock comfortable without extra charge explain agent quickly print paperwork we cross line we signunfortunately come unstuck semifriendly term do not bother read small print be not get home receive credit card statement saw charge double expect senior citizen unwelcome surprise especially limited budgeti understand trust anyone always read small print signingin future able visit usa certainly use fox car rentalsbeware,29,August,2022

"2 Fox shuttles at LAX passed myself, wife and 7 year old which meant we waited around an hour for a shuttle - we were only at T3 so there is no way BOTH busses were full.  We were absolutely astounded that this occurred but it got worse unfortunately.  Desperate to make our appointment, we decided to get on a Hertz bus as we thought Hertz was close to Fox and we could walk across - we were desperate to get to Fox.  Unfortunately, Hertz was a long way away from Fox so we were forced to get an Uber from Hertz to Fox which then cost around $23... When we finally got to fox 2 hours after our flight arrived at LAX, we found a fairly indignant man behind the counter who acted and appeared like he couldn't care less about our 2 hour journey from our plane to Fox.  He was overly careless about it.  Not his problem apparently - well it certainly was ours. We had rented the VERY bottom of the range car because we would barely be driving it in the one week rental we had booked.  We booked a full size vehicle for $288 for the week, however, the man behind the counter told us that the only car he had was a compact car and forced us to take this car.  IT WASN'T EVEN THE FULL SIZED CAR WE HAD BOOKED, BUT HE STILL CHARGED US FOR THE FULL SIZE CAR AND NOT THE COMPACT CAR.  So Fox now owes me the difference. But the money isnt the point for me as it was only $10 difference - but FOX sets the costs so you need to honor it and NOT RIP OFF YOUR CUSTOMERS - especially after such a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE experience.If you look up my record with FOX, I have rented from your many many times but not over the past year - I was dismayed that your service has become so poor in the gap between renting from your LAX office.  Please contact me to make good on the money you owe me for the difference in the car that was provided - it would be great to get my Uber ride $$$ back from you and also a credit on my next rental.

"Car was reasonable. It was comfortable and seemed okay; we had issues with the tyre pressure dropping below an acceptable level while we were driving and had to top them up ourselves. Also, as many other people have stated, the volume of hidden charges is gastronomical. Our rental more than doubled in cost as we were required to sign for insurances and extra drivers on arrival. None of this was declared on booking and had it been, we would have gone elsewhere. The staff at the Denver airport depot are rude too. They look at you like dirt when you ask them to explain what insurances you are signing for and why they’re so expensive. They also try and sell you products you don’t need (like an £11/day pass for the express lane on interstates) and don’t listen when you say no thank you. I’ve had nothing but problems with the customer service since we left and money is simply removed from your credit card with no notice.

"FOX rental car from 9/8 to 9/16/2022.  This rental was prepaid thru an Expedia reservation, 3 months before the rental date.  Late at night on 9/8/2022, they gave me a 3 year old vehicle with 65,000 miles, and it shook at 55 MPH.  The next day, called and told them about it.  They told me to take it back, and they would exchange it.  I did that. The next one was a 2 year old car with 55,000 miles. When I got my credit card statement, I found that they had charged me for a 1-day rental when I exchanged the defective car on the second day, but I prepaid, so there should have been no additional charge.

I managed to get this refunded but as you can imagine was quite worrying when I hadn't expected it.

"Made rental reservations for Fox Rent A Car (Guayaquil Ecuador Airport)on the Expedia site, Fox car rental is owned by Europcar. The main reason I picked this company is it offered unlimited miles, I even showed them this when I picked up the car and paid at the airport. When I returned the car they tell me that I owe $430 for going over the miles as its not unlimited. I asked for a mgr/supervisor so I can discuss (no Mgr to call or speak to I was told), since the rep that was there said she it was expedia's fault because they had an error on the site. She also said I have to pay or she will call airport police and I won't be allowed to board my flight home. I paid so I can get back to the US and dispute with Corporate, Expedia and Amex. When I tried looking for a contact # for Europcar Customer Service, there is only an email, which proved to be useless. Called Expedia and they emailed me back 5 days later that they had the same luck I did reaching Europcar, I was told if I would have paid with Expedia they would have given me a refund. But like I paid with Fox Rent A Car there was little Expedia can do to get my money back. I disputed charge with Amex, after about a month later was denied dispute by Amex as I signed  for the $430 charge and the original bill didn't say unlimited miles. I told Amex that the original bill failed to say there was a limit to the amount of miles the rental came with. Long story short, use another car rental company if you don't want to get fleeced. Here is the reply to your reply, I would think that if your company got my Expedia reservation details (unlimited miles) your rep at the counter should have mention that important detail. All she told me was that I would be responsible for any speeding tickets given to me since the country has a lot of speeding cameras and that there would be a hold on some $$$ on my card to make sure your company has the funds to pay the said tickets if I got them. DON'T YOU THINK THE MORE IMPORTANT DETAILS OF THE MILES NOT BEING UNLIMITED SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED?? BUT LIKE YOU ARE COUNTING ON THE EXTRA $$ YOUR CORRUPT COMPANY GETS FROM UNSUSPECTING CUSTOMERS.

"This was the worst place I have ever had to deal with!! First, when we got off the plane they wouldn’t take our reservations because it was on a debit card and they won’t accept debit.

The night before we were leaving the check engine light came on, called to let them know but no answer. Woke up at 5 AM to start the car to go to the airport for our flight at 8 and it wouldn’t crank!!! Called fox for an hour before anybody would answer and at that time it was 6. Fox said they wouldn’t pick us up and take us to the airport but they can send out someone to look at the car and it will take 74 minutes for someone to arrive. We had to call an Uber and pay for them to take my family to the airport so we wouldn’t miss our flight. I called fox to tell them we got an Uber and they will need to get the car. They said they are charging me for abandonment and charging to get the vehicle to their parking lot, an extra $10 a mile!! I am warning you, DO NOT RENT from these crooked people.

"The worst customer service I’ve ever experienced.Our flight to San Francisco was delayed by 24hrs. We emailed and called the company to advise them of this. When we arrived there was a huge wait and we stood in line listening to some very abrupt and rude staff.When we got to the desk, the paperwork had to be completed again in  spite of us having advised them of our delay.They added on all sorts of charges for insurance, tolls and wanted payment up front for fuel, supposedly at a discounted rate which turned out to be no less that the regular pump price.At the time of booking there was no mention of the fact that they will not accept debit cards for payment, we were only told this at the desk.Neither my wife or I knew the PIN numbers for our credit cards - we only ever use them online - so we asked if we could pay them by going online or by calling but they refused this. I asked if we could use their Wi-Fi so I could log into my bank app and find my PIN, they refused. We even offered full payment in cash as a final desperate measure but this was refused too.They didn’t care that we were a family of four with two young children who would be stuck in San Francisco with no  car.In the end we took their shuttle back to the airport and went to Avis who accepted payment with a debit card, added no extra charges and we had a car within 10 minutes of arrival.If I could give Fox zero stars the I would, their service and the whole experience topped off what had already been a challenging travel day and their lack of flexibility and unwillingness to help was disgusting.Do NOT use Fox!",1,US,2022-08-16,Negative,bad customer service I ve ever experiencedour flight san francisco delay hrs email call company advise arrive huge wait stand line listen abrupt rude staffwhen get desk paperwork complete spite we advise delaythey add sort charge insurance toll want payment front fuel supposedly discount rate turn less regular pump priceat time booking mention fact accept debit card payment tell deskneither wife know pin number credit card ever use online ask could pay go online calling refuse ask could use wifi could log bank app find pin refuse even offer full payment cash final desperate measure refuse toothey do not care family four two young child would stuck san francisco carin end take shuttle back airport go avis accept payment debit card add extra charge car within minute arrivalif could give fox zero star would service whole experience top already challenge travel day lack flexibility unwillingness help disgustingdo use fox,16,August,2022

Upon arrival at Cabo airport and EuroFox's rental counter, they verified we booked and drove us to the rental car parking lot. As soon as we got inside the clerk attempted to sell us their insurance and charge 3X the amount listed on Fox’s website quote.

"Update:  FOX responded by telling me where I could find the policy on the sunpass.  That’s it.!   No one is taking accountability for anything !   It took multiple attempts to drive off with a decent clean car on top of the misinformation given regarding the sun pass. The gas policy was written on a separate paper with the damage policy of which I happen to read as we attempted to drive off.  They didn’t even offer a discount/refund for our troubles considering that we wasted time ( 1 1/2 hours ) waiting for them to get it together!  Let’s ignore  the fact that they charged us for a full tank of gas but actually gave 3/4.  If I didn’t check the gauge before I pulled off the lot that would have also been our problem. Basically if you choose to rent from them you must double check behind these people on everything because they aren’t an honest company that stands by their word or product . Save yourself the headache .  Go somewhere else.   The WORST experience ever !   We arrived and the agent explained options and that we can get a sun pass for $11.99 and didn’t have to worry about tolls , we can get prepaid gas, didn’t have to fillBefore return etc etc.  Sounds Great so  Mr signed, trusting what the Rep saidand neglected to read the fine print on  contract before signing  because we were very tired due to the flight delays.   We  get the keys get to a Mitsubishi Outlander and it was absolutely filthy, scratched and dented and the arm rest  inside was worn and nasty looking.  I refuse to get in it so Mr goes back Inside and returns the car and rents another.   This car was  Nissan Murano which was better but all the windows including the side mirrors  were all dirty and there was dirt on the floor and armrest inside.   I was aggravated so I took wipes out of my bag and wiped the armrest and seats off and we get in.  We now drive towards the exit and noticed we don’t have a full tank of gas !!!   Aggravated ,  we go back AGAIN and return the car and they apologize  and take the car to get washed and to fill the tank.  20 mins later we get in and there is water running down the front windshield.  We can’t even see!  We put on the windshield wipers clean it off so we can see and finally drive off……...1 1/2 hrs later!  Here is the bait and switch …..  We are back home in NJ now and took a closer look at the contract and realize the agent lied……it was $11.99 A DAY not $11.99 for the rental .You have got to be kidding me!  Who is spending  that much a day on tolls ?????   This sun pass was an additional $88 on top of the rental fees.  What a ripoff!   When we call to complain we were told we should have read the contract and Mr signed it so we are responsible.  I tell the Rep Actually we had to switch cars so we didn’t sign the second contract.   She said that doesn’t matter we are still responsible for it since we signed for the 1st car that we didn’t take.  Horrible horrible experience .

The shuttle service was excellent.  I note this because I have to use special assistance in the airport.  The drop off and pick up is a six to seven minute walk.

"We were charged $1,500 over the quoted rental fee.

We were talked into other insurances as well, totally unnecessary I think, which upped the price also dramatically.  When we returned the car they also wanted to charge us for cleaning, $250, but there was a car wash nearby and I vacuumed the car for $3.  We waited over an half hour for their airport shuttle, which made us late for check in at the airport.  The shuttle is supposed to run every 10 min, but two passed us by saying they were on break.  When I enquired about it at the counter, the agent said he was busy with another customer.  The driver of the shuttle also dropped us off at the wrong terminal which made us additionally late.  In short, I'm very upset about the end cost of the rental and find it very misleading to the customer to say it will cost something, then have a whopping $1,500 additional costs.

When I tried to call the ""local"" phone number listed for my city, it just re-routed me to the call center.  As soon as I found my license stolen and before my car rental time, I called Fox to find an alternative solution, even picking up the car late in order to get a replacement licence or swithing the reservation to my wife's name so she could pick it up but they couldn't offer any help at the call center.

"Great, quick check-in. Shuttles were timely. Received a hybrid vehicle, which was great. It had 80,000+ miles on it and was 3 years old. It had lots of wear and tear- dings, dents, scrapes, hail damage, etc. The car was not clean inside or out, which was disappointing. Then we had a tire issue within 2 hours. It cost us half a day of our vacation to get the tire repaired and then to get it replaced. I am just hoping we do get the reimbursement we were promised. I don't care about a beat up car, as long as it's safe and clean, but this car wasn't safe with the tire issue, and it was definitely not clean. Two out of the three customer service reps who helped with the tire issue were great. The third one (Kia) was rude and gave us incorrect information. I was on hold for one call for 35 minutes before I was able to reach someone the day we had the tire issue, and I had to call 3 other times, each of those times with a 15 minute wait. I will say that we got a good price on the rental, and we did like the car itself. The shuttles were good, and the rental process was quick and painless- no pressure.

"I rented a car with Fox for a little over a week (July 26th-August 6th, 2022) from the Ontario Airport location. My personal experience was very good. I arrived a little early due to my plane arriving early, but they were ready for me. The pick up process itself was quick. I've had issues with damage and I check THOROUGHLY, but there was a young man there who did not appreciate me taking my time to check the car out. I wasn't even working with him, but he felt the need to comment on what I was doing. When you have had issues in the past and car rental places trying to place the repair on you, you learn to be thorough. The young lady I was working with did attempt to comfort me in saying they weren't that type of company and that they were looking for scratches longer than a pen/pencil, dents and big issues that would render the car not rentable.Now there were a couple of things you need to be prepared for that you aren't told beforehand, especially if you are renting using a 3rd party. You are told that you have to pay for their insurance, which you don't have to. Check with your insurance to ensure it will pay for any damage otherwise, that's like $400+ they are going to charge your card. There was another one but I don't recall what it was. None the less be sure you are paying attention and save yourself some time and hassle later on. Overall, the experience was a good one. A couple of people don't make an establishment bad nor do a couple make it good. It's a team effort and overall their team effort is good.

"Rental price and airport transfer is excellent but there are drawbacks compared to the large companies:Both cars I hired had several dents not marked on the paperwork. I was not comfortable with their system that you need to take photos to evidence that they were there on collection. On return, no dents were challenged so was not a problem.One car had maintenance issues of one tire greatly over inflated and another underinflated. After correcting this it still did not steer in a straight line (tire wear suggests tracking needs adjusting).Need to book and pay with a credit card in the name of the hirer appears unnecessary. Also, for free additional driver, need proof that you have the same surname.Insurance is overpriced so purchased excess insurance in the UK through another company.",4,US,2022-07-23,Positive,rental price airport transfer excellent drawback compare large companiesboth car hire several dent mark paperwork comfortable system need take photo evidence collection return dent challenge problemone car maintenance issue one tire greatly inflate another underinflated correct still steer straight line tire wear suggest tracking need adjustingneed book pay credit card name hirer appear unnecessary also free additional driver need proof surnameinsurance overprice purchase excess insurance uk another company,23,July,2022

"I wanted to give a big shout out to the Fox Rental Car Team at the Phoenix Airport! On behalf of our team, Thank you! We were traveling as a missions team of 22 from Virginia. We rented 3 minivans and an SUV. We were under the impression that we would be getting a Mid sized SUV to accommodate all our gear and overflow luggage per our travel agent. Instead, waiting for us, was a small SUV that was not adequate for our needs. The last SUV literally pulled off the lot right ahead of us. Thanks to our agent, Rosalia Hernendez and the rest of the team that were involved (Kyle, Mike, Haider, and Youseff), They were able to find us and upgrade us to a Grand Cherokee at no extra cost! What could have been a very frustrating experience, turned out to be a model of customer service that is often lost in today's world.  From the time we checked in with Yvonne on 7/8/2022 at 330 pm we had a seamless and efficient start of our trip. Even employees that were at other windows were very personable. I don't think I have ever given out a 100% 10 out of 10 rating, but this difficult situation and how it was made easy, warranted it! Thanks Rosalia, you were great!!! and Thank you Fox Phoenix for doing business in a way that made us feel cared for!

I had no wait time for the shuttle from the airport and the shuttle driver wasted no time getting me from the airport to the fox off airport location.  I had reserved a camry or similar and received a 4dr jeep wrangler. Check in took only a few minutes and I was on my way. I bought the damage waiver (insurance) and tank of gas and this made returning the vehicle even easier.  Upon returning the vehicle, the lot attendant took the keys processed the return and I didn't have to go in to the rental counter at all.  I was the first of about 8 other customers to enter the shuttle and the drive left moments later. The only down side was,  the jeep was not the cleanest inside or out. Not shoddy but not spotless either.  My rental, plus insurance, plus prepaid fuel was about the same total price as the Camry through other rental agencies without the fuel and insurance... basically a savings of about $200.",5,US,2022-07-19,Positive,read negative review say even come close actual experience wait time shuttle airport shuttle driver waste time get airport fox airport location reserve camry similar receive dr jeep wrangl check take minute way buy damage waiver insurance tank gas make return vehicle even easy upon return vehicle lot attendant take key process return do not go rental counter first customer enter shuttle drive leave moment later side jeep clean inside shoddy spotless either rental plus insurance plus prepaid fuel total price camry rental agency without fuel insurance basically saving,19,July,2022

When I booked this reservation through Priceline, I paid around $500. By the end of my experience with Fox, I had paid nearly $2000. Absolutely horrible! The only good thing I can say about this experience is that the car itself was in fine working condition and I didn't have any issues with it.

"Customer service was friendly and the car was nice. They offered an upgrade at the counter but didn't push it when we said no thanks, which I appreciated.However, I do have two complaints. One, it was not clear when we booked the car online through Expedia that whoever pays for the car is the primary driver. If I had known this, I would not have booked the car myself because I am under 25. I never actually drove the car on the entire trip and we still had to pay the extra fee for having a driver under 25 because we had used my credit card to reserve it. I'm not sure if this was Expedia's fault, Fox's fault, or mine for failing to see a piece of information that SHOULD have been placed in an obvious place but was not.Secondly, and this was a bigger deal to me: the lady at the counter LIED to us and said that having them fill up the car for us when we returned it would be a comparable price to gas costs in the area. She said that it would be $6.35 a gallon and said that this was actually lower than gas costs in San Diego. After driving around a bit we discovered this was not the case at all. But what was worse was when we returned the car and they charged us $9 a gallon. Not $6.35. It was disappointing and frustrating to be conned out of our money like that. I did the math and we would have paid about $57 to fill it up ourselves instead of the $88 they charged us. It didn't raise our estimated cost by much but it was the deception about the cost that bothered me.Anyway, we won't use Fox again.",3,US,2022-07-02,Neutral,customer service friendly car nice offer upgrade counter do not push say thank appreciatedhowever two complaint one clear book car online expedia whoever pay car primary driver know would booked car never actually drive car entire trip still pay extra fee driver use credit card reserve I m sure expedias fault foxs fault mine fail see piece information place obvious place notsecondly big deal lady counter lie we say fill car we return would comparable price gas cost area say would gallon say actually low gas cost san diego drive around bit discover case bad return car charge we gallon disappointing frustrating con money like math would pay fill instead charge we do not raise estimate cost much deception cost bother meanyway will not use fox,2,July,2022

Ivan did a great job of taking care of us and advising us in the different options and add-one that are available, to make our experience trouble free. The car was in great shape and clean. When we returned the car Daveena made it easy and quick, we didn’t even have to go into the office.

"Bad experience and horrible customer service from Fox Rent A Car   ….. rented a car from Fox Rent A Car ( probably for the last time) through Priceline. Price line offered $13 Collision protection and told us we can add it when we pick up the car at Austin Airport. Fox counter agent said they would not honor the $13, even when we have the screen shot to prove, and said Fox’s price is $20 , take it or leave it. That was bad enough, but when I got the receipt in email, we were charged $23.99 plus a about 20% in taxes. Called the number on the receipt, had to wait for about 30 minutes before getting an agent, all the while hearing about the ‘corporate character’, to be told by the agent that he doesn’t care that their employee misrepresented the price at the time of sales. And won’t transfer me to anyone else. Possibly because he would get tagged for not providing right resolution. Not that the $24 they charged extra is a big deal over close to $700 business we gave them. It reflects the company character and their employees accountability.

"am extremely disappointed in Fox Rental Car. I usually rent from two other rental car agencies and I tried Fox this time and I will not use them again. My initial reservation was for 1 week and it was $220. We wanted to extend our reservation by a week and to extend it was an ADDITIONAL $504, which included a $190 “extension fee”.This is a shady way to “force” your current customers to pay more, simply because you can. They said they can only give a discount on the rate when it is reserved, not once it’s already rented. For better customer retention, wouldn’’t it be better to take care of the customers you already have instead of penalizing them? Very disappointed, very unprofessional, shady and underhanded policy. The answer via representative via phone and chat, said “this is system generated and we cannot change it”. Such a feeble excuse in 2022’s technology because programming could change this, therefore Fox Rental Cars CHOOSE NOT TOO. and TAKE ADVANTAGE to get more money out of their existing customers. They say they “are sorry but will tell you it’s on their website and on the rental agreement you sign”, and of course, it is, it’s in the FINE PRINT.  What about full disclosure at the rental counter of charges like this that might impact the customer at the time you are at the rental counter? I won’t be back at Fox Rental Cars, unless they credit me $190. I can understand a rate change per day by a little but not a huge increase perhaps, but not a fee that is simply screwing THEIR customer because you have them and they have little choice.",1,CA,2022-06-10,Negative,extremely disappointed fox rental car usually rent two rental car agency try fox time use initial reservation week want extend reservation week extend additional include extension feethis shady way force current customer pay simply say give discount rate reserve already rent well customer retention would not well take care customer already instead penalize disappointed unprofessional shady underhande policy answer via representative via phone chat say system generate change feeble excuse technology programming could change therefore fox rental car choose take advantage get money exist customer say sorry tell website rental agreement sign course fine print full disclosure rental counter charge like might impact customer time rental counter will not back fox rental car unless credit understand rate change per day little huge increase perhaps fee simply screw customer little choice,10,June,2022

"Let me express my frustration regarding Fox rental cars. Although the confirmation stated that everything was paid for and settled and we didn't have to pay anything more when we picked up the car, we had to pay extra taxes, a deposit and a full petrol tank. All in all, about 400$ extra! In addition, the extra insurance that we had paid with you with the reservation turned out to be invalid according to the official because it was from a third party and we would be insured for nothing if we did not pay another insurance that he proposed to me on the spot. He also tried to tell me that you can't drive through California without an EZ pass which you also have to buy from him. Fortunately I know better, but my confidence was already completely gone at that point.Although we arrived two hours later than planned it turned out that the car was not ready and we would have to wait another half hour, but if we did not want that we could get a smaller car right away.

"The most horrible experience I have ever had with a rental car company. The first car had squeaking breaks, the wheel pulled to the left, no iso-fix for the carseat, very small trunk space and roaches (2). I had to drive all the way back to Miami to return it for these reasons only later to find out that it could have been returned at any fox rental center, however I had been misinformed by the representative I spoke with. Not to mention Miami was a 4 hour drive from where we were staying. The manager seemed to be unmoved by my concerns but did end up giving me a larger vehicle with better trunk space and iso-fix for the carseat to connect. However when I tell you the replacement car was even worse than the previous one that's a complete understatement. There were foot prints on the windshield from where the previous passenger had had their feet up meaning it was never cleaned, the back of the passenger headrest had grease stains so that had not been cleaned or wiped down either, the windshield wiper fluid was not wiper fluid at all but WATER and therefor did absolutely nothing!!! The passenger window never rolled down, the breaks were also squeaky on this car but not only that the steering wheel shook violently when stepping on the breaks so that break pads had not been changed in god knows how long! Completely unsafe! And last but not least the front right headlight was out which we discovered day 2 of driving the vehicle. I really can't make this stuff up. I could have easily returned the car for a third vehicle but I was afraid that one might have a wheel pop off while driving. It was obvious the quality of the vehicles supplied to customers so it was meaningless to even try. Needless to say it was the worse experience of my life and I would never recommend nor use FOX rental cars again.",1,US,2022-06-02,Negative,horrible experience ever rental car company first car squeaking break wheel pull leave isofix carseat small trunk space roach drive way back miami return reason later find could return fox rental center however misinformed representative speak mention miami hour drive staying manager seem unmoved concern end give large vehicle well trunk space isofix carseat connect however tell replacement car even bad previous one that s complete understatement foot print windshield previous passenger foot mean never clean back passenger headr grease stain clean wipe either windshield wiper fluid wiper fluid water therefor absolutely nothing passenger window never roll break also squeaky car steering wheel shake violently step break break pad change god know long completely unsafe last least front right headlight discover day drive vehicle really can not make stuff could easily return car third vehicle afraid one might wheel pop drive obvious quality vehicle supply customer meaningless even try needless say bad experience life would never recommend use fox rental car,2,June,2022

"Tuesday May 31, 2022 Good Afternoon Team! I wanted to take a moment and let you know that as someone who regularly provides reviews online, that I would simply state the following to the American Public who travels regularly. You all need to understand the following. 1. This is an off-airport location and you must take a shuttle to an off airport site. 2. The reason that you are even doing business with Fox Rent A Car is that they offer inexpensive rental rates, without fail. Now with that in mind, and the fact that rental cars in 2022 are being priced in some markets as much as 10x pre Covid-19, you have to admit… you simply wanted the deal…. Thus the results you are presenting here and your subsequent commentary. My experience was simple. As the CEO and President of A Large company, I deal with client service matters daily. I made the CHOICE to book with Fox Rent a Car… I am a Presidential Isle member at Avis, and diamond and platinum at all other agencies, including private jet rentals (Net Jets) however,  I made the same decision you did to rent from Fox, even after reading the reviews. Based on this decision, I spoke to the site manager in Salt Lake City, Roselynn and her associate Alex, whom both have exceptional customer service skills. How was I able to create such a pleasant outcome? I presented myself at the rental counter and was calm... And not demanding or entitled. I did not make demands, but merely relaxed and picked up my car, thus the entire Salt Lake City staff mirrored my gratitude and I was given a 5 star treatment. Note that during the booking, review and vetting process of the Company, I read the reviews All of them. I even researched the CEO Mike Jaberi, who is based out of Los Angeles. I knew that it was MY obligation to DOCUMENT any and all prior damage to the vehicle, (done using an IPHONE 13 PRO MAX WITH 4k digital quality 102 Photos) as well as to ensure that it was agreed by and between the parties that the car had not been smoked in. Once all of the photos and documents were completed, I left feeling like a valued client. The bottom line is that if you want 5 star service, you MUST provide that same 5 star customer that they, as a Corporation, are looking for. Believe me, they want your business, and I am sure the management team nationwide would spend thousands per client if each client were able to create a win between the Company and the Customer. WE SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR ON CLIENT AND CORPORATE ACQUISITION. IN CONCLUSION, If you follow my instructions, you will be guaranteed success in all of your transactions, READ THIS AT LEAST 3 TIMES BEFORE WRITING A NEGATIVE REVIEW, and ALWAYS document the facts (previous damage) as if you are an attorney going to Court. I am proud to be a repeat client of Fox Rent A Car! Again, thanks Roz and Alex! To your success, Robert Paisola President and CEO Western Capital International 1-800-373-8913 x 702 Cc: Mike Jaberi via LinkedIn, Los Angeles",5,CH,2022-06-01,Positive,tuesday may good afternoon team want take moment let know someone regularly provide review online would simply state follow american public travel regularly need understand follow offairport location must take shuttle airport site reason even business fox rent car offer inexpensive rental rate without fail mind fact rental car price market much x pre covid admit simply want deal thus result present subsequent commentary experience simple ceo president large company deal client service matter daily make choice book fox rent car presidential isle member avis diamond platinum agency include private jet rental net jet however make decision rent fox even read review base decision speak site manager salt lake city roselynn associate alex exceptional customer service skill able create pleasant outcome present rental counter calm demand entitle make demand merely relax pick car thus entire salt lake city staff mirror gratitude give star treatment note book review vetting process company read review even research ceo mike jaberi base los angeles know obligation document prior damage vehicle do use iphone pro max k digital quality photo well ensure agree party car smoke photo document complete left feeling like value client bottom line want star service must provide star customer corporation looking believe want business sure management team nationwide would spend thousand per client client able create win company customer spend million dollar year client corporate acquisition conclusion follow instruction guarantee success transaction read least time write negative review always document fact previous damage attorney go court proud repeat client fox rent car thank roz alex success robert paisola president ceo western capital international x cc mike jaberi via linkedin los angeles,1,June,2022
"My transatlantic flight was cancelled due to technical issues, so I got to the car rental 24h later. Fox Rent A Car had already declared a no-show on my reservation as their holdup time is max 12h, even if you alert them beforehand.

The hotel, Home2Suits by Hilton, on the contrary, had a much smarter and honest policy. They immediately updated the reservation with the new dates when I explained the reason for the late arrival.

After many calls, and being sent to the wrong repair places, they finally brought me a different Jeep Wrangler.  Guess what!  It ALSO had a death wobble.  I've since learned this is a maintenance issue with these vehicles and the death wobble is a KNOWN problem.  All in all the problems ended up costing me over $300 additional dollars and NO ONE.....not ONE person who can make a decision will return a phone call of email to even discuss this.

"Zero Rating.  Do NOT USE THIS COMPANY! I was told by the agent at Orlando counter that I did not need to fill up the tank upon return of car, because Fox charges LESS than gas in the area.

Worse, the car spun out and I 70 spinning five or six times down the highway is a result of the tires having two millimeters of tread, which is completely unlawful.  We could not use the rental car the entire trip as it could not make it up a small grade. Fox would not stand behind its product, and the tire companies informed us that this was common, and when Fox would advise the customer to fix the tires for them (effectively perform maintenance on the vehicles they neglected) they would stiff them.

"I rented a ""Fox Rent a Car"" car through rentalcars.com for $300 at their Denver airport offsite location. They snuck in an extra $500 for insurance that I didn't ask for. I didn't see it until I received the receipt when I returned the car. Fox Rent A Car in Denver has deceptive practices when signing their contract. Their representative does not present the contract to you and has you sign a blank digital pad where they take your signature and add it to a contract that they don't show you. I have never been to a car rental place that does this. The representative I spoke to did not tell me he was adding insurance to my purchase, and he never showed me his computer screen. He could have altered the contract after the fact for all I know. Moreover, the initials under the insurance section do not match the initials for the rest of the signatures.I reached out to their email they have plastered all over their review responses, ""billing at foxrentacar.com"", numerous times, the last time being February 2, 2022. I have not received a response from them since January 31, 2022. They are unresponsive. Do not bother with this company, you'll end up paying more in the end with them.EDIT: I called the number the merchant provided in a response to this review.

I am very dissatisfied with Fox Rental in Los Angeles. They refused to honor the Jeep Grand Cherokee even though there were Cherokee Grands available. They offered me a Mitsubishi Outlander that was a sub-par vehicle. Not anywhere comparable or similar to the Jeep Grand Cherokee. They directed me to section 11 that contained only heavily used and worn vehicles. When I questioned the Fleet Managet about it he became somewhat hostile in nature. He informed me that I had reserved the older Jeep Grand Cherokee and that I could not have the newer ones because they had more seats. I instantly knew that Fox was telling me lies to capture an upgrade. I did upgrade paying more so that my children would be safe. I hold Priceline Fox and Booking.com for unethical business practices that may be systemic and illegal. I would like a refund for the amount they charged for an  upgrade or I will refer your practices to the US District Attorney's office.

They blow the screen up so you can only see the signature page and given that I had told the employee I did not want the insurance, I trusted him to follow my request. Instead he ripped me off and my $425 weekly hire became $900! The gentleman also said to bring the car back without fuel as they only charge you for what you’ve used. This is also not true as I took it back 3/4 full and was charged for half a tank. The standard reply to all of these complaints is that they’re happy to ‘review the rental agreement’, (which as I mentioned, they con you in to signing by enlarging the screen to show just the signature box).

"Tried dropping off a rental car back to them when I had a flight out that morning on Saturday. Swung by and no one was there around 545 am. The office was closed but no one was there early to even take the car at all and I didn't want to miss my flight out for a 720 am. When the office finally opened I called when I was waiting for the plane and was thru security and tried to explain to the customer service representative on the phone about this and they didn't want to listen at all. They didn't want to try and work with me on this. Was never told about how to drop it off the car when picking it up. When the person finally said fine we will tell the office there and I gave the number of the spot to the person on the phone to have someone that day come by to pick it up. They never did since I got a call a week later which they never picked up due to not finding the spot. I even told them on the phone originally I have photos to show and let them know that. Now they are wanting to charge $600 on top of a pre-paid reservation thru Priceline I was already charged $250 with no receipt showing why, which I am disputing all of the charges due to this and now they are going to send me to collections since they didn't want to work with me on any of this at all and didn't want to listen since they only care about getting their money. So being in Hospitality myself there are things that should be considered and not be charged at all. None of the people that I have spoken to HAVEN'T been helpful or even understanding, the last person I spoke to said that it wasn't their fault and I have to paid this.

Do not rent a car at this company they are awful. I booked a car through Discovercars showing Europcar eventually it was Fox in Orlando near MCO.- Staff is very rude- They tried to charge $400 more than we booked for.- We received 3 cars before we were able to leave with a normal car.

"I had made a booking through Orbitz for a car collected from Orland Florida close to the airport. That booking didn’t include any type of insurance as I had a separate one. On the day of collection, the lady who assisted me asked me if I wanted to add insurance and I told her no, explaining that I am covered already. Without me realising it as I was never explained this, she added insurance. When she asked me to use my credit card, she told me that that was for the security deposit and not to make the final payment for the reservation. She told me to sign at different stages but it was never cleared to me that I was also purchasing insurance. Trusting her job, I did everything I was asked to, I got the keys and left. On the day I returned the car, I was expecting to pay for my booking as I was told I would pay at the end of it. When I dropped the car, the gentleman cho checked the car and collected back the keys, answered to my question that everything was completed and I was ready to leave and have me taken to the airport. I then checked my emails and realised I was charged nearly double the amount of my original booking! I went back to the office and asked to speak to the manager. I was there for nearly 45 minutes. I was told that I should have checked my email from the beginning and checked what the lady had me sign and charged. She is right! I should have! It was my mistake that I had trusted the employee! When she was asked to explain what had happened, the employee who had originally served me lied in front of my face saying that I told that my insurance doesn’t cover the rental! Then why didn’t I add it at the first place? I offered to show to them my contract with a third party company. They declined my offer! Long story short and after a long and unpleasant conversation, they agreed to refund me approximately 70% of the added value they had charged me, but never agreed to refund me the total amount of the insurance I never verbally agreed as I was never explained at the first place. I was fully trusting the employee and I shouldn’t have! But the manager, should have the capacity to understand a customer who speaks the truth versus someone who is trying to get away with things! Utterly horrible experience and at the last minute. I don’t understand why you don’t accept payment on day one, so that misunderstandings can be avoided!

"Be aware I would nevet rent a car from them again was a nightmare cost me over double what I had agreement for! They will scam you anyway they can! First my flight was postponed for a day due to lack of pilots so I called and changed the rental for following day! The  next day i arrived at Tampa airport and there was not one person there in line at 10:30 am but took them over an hr to give me a car! They said they didnt have the car i specifically reserved and needed for the purpose of my trip! They then said they couldnt use paperwork on reaervation and had to make a whole new one which ended up a higher price than what I rented it on thrU expedia which was not only cheaper but was for four days to begin with and this was only for three days and was more! Then, I got a small compact with no leg room for my husband was cramped and had a four hr drive! The car was dirty on inside and i pointed it out to the man who did walk around and they want you to sign paper about condition of car! I told him i didnt want to sign because inside was not clean and i didnt want to be held responsible looked like someone smoked inside and if there were any burn holes i wouldnt be responsible! I did look and didnt see burn holes and by this point we were already late so i signed and he said dont worry they only care about the outside for damage! I said i always clean car before i return it and obviously this one wasnt cleaned! He said oh you do not have to worry and i said really that is good to know because I have a four he drive to make my plane next day so if i hit traffic and dont have time to vaccuum I am ok? Yes he said! So on way back we hit accident and we got to airport cutting it close but I could have stopped to vaccuum but the car was in same shape as when we got it so we decided to not stop to vacuum and just get into terminal. We hadnt even put the car in park nor had I even got my belongings out of car and a large black man pushes the young girl aside and starts telling me we have to pay 500 dollars for smoking in the car! I looked at him like he was some nut! We never smoked in car in fact my husband cant stand the smell of smoke and would nevet ever let anyone smoke around him let alone in a compact car! I asked the man why he accused us falsely and he said there were ashes in the car and he had to take it off lot to fumagate it! I said show me because the car was dirty when we picked it up but I couldnt tell if it was ashes or sand or dirt! He wouldnt show me and i said i have time i didnt have to return car until two more hrs. i did have a flight to catch but I could have run to corner and vacuumed it and sprayed with ionizer! Then i would have take  it to another rental place like hertz to verify the car was clean and had no smell he claimed it had! But he refused! I called company headquarters and complained he instantly had charged my card! They said they would look into it and week later Theh said they had pictures and I said show me! They sent email with no pictures that would open never saw any pictures! I called my credit card company! They reversed charges! Suddenly months later the charges were put back on with no explanation! I belief the black man was prejudice because he ran over and took over processing the car before i even got out but my husband had gotten out and he has long hair! We were wearing concert clothes because we were at a four day music festival and had to leave by 4 am to make it from daytona to Tampa and hadnt showered or slept we had a bon fire at friends place was a cold night. Little did they know we were not some smoking hippi losers! I have a masters degree and he owns a successful high end business for 30 yrs! So I paid 1000 dollars for three day rental of a compact car! They were very rude to us! They had no customers and now we know why!!! Do not rent from Fox not worth it! I rent in Fl at least three times a year never had any issues ever!!!!! First time I rented from cheaper place and wished I hadn't!! I just received an email with Fox Rental car's response to my review that stated so sorry and to contac them! Are you serious Fox rental car is that your automated response to all your negative reviews! Not only did I contact Fox more than once when this occurred including the minute I left the rude man who charged my cc without my permission, my credit card company tried to resolve this issue with your company and also got no where! It is a joke to you to take a hard working person's 500 dollars on top of the additional money you already scammed on top of the agreed original contract! Ruined a vacation budgeted during a time where financially american's are struggling! But you believe that someone should be charged 500 dollars for a car they didnt reaerve and was given to them dirty and it was noted during walk around and it will cost you 500 dollars to vacuum it and spray some ionizer spray would take you 15 mins to clean and cost you with labor what 10 dollars!

"The only real complaint I have is with the quality of the vehicle I was given.  On October 26th, of 2021, I reserved an all-wheel drive SUV from Fox, SPECIFICALLY because I knew I'd be travelling to a location with snowy and/or icy road conditions.  But when I arrived, on Decemeber 29th, to pick up my reserved all-wheel drive SUV, I was told that if I wanted something other than a two-wheel drive vehicle, I would have to pay $503.13 per day -- $400 more than my reserve confirmation estimate.  That is, by anyone's definition, a bait-and-switch -- which I believe is illegal.  At no point was I forewarned, so that I might make other arrangements; no, your company waited until I was at an off-airport location, with severely limited options, other than to accept a downgraded vehicle from Fox.  To add insult to injury, I was charged the exact same amount for a less safe vehicle.

"Fox DENVER airport was all in all horrible experience. They were nice upfront however when we turned the car in it was horrible. We rented the car from Priceline for $617. We thought that was the flat rate as it was advertised however we got hit with OVER $300 of charges when turning in the car. When I brought it up to the first guy he was all defensive and an absolute jerk!. Went to get his manager and she was worse.  The Manager was beyond unprofessional and tried to defend that it’s not false advertisement.  We were told “it’s not false advertisement..maybe false understanding!”  Not exactly customer service.  No attempt was made to break down the extra charges…only told multiple times, “false understanding!”   Horrible customer service and management at DENVER AIRPORT! Do NOT fall for FOX Prices as they are not true. YOU will have close to $300 in extra charges if you rent the car for a week. IF I were you DO NOT RENT FROM FOX!! Horrible! please listen to my review. I personally read about the charges and bad reviews from fox however I still chose to go with them. HORRIBLE DECISION!! We read multiple horrible reviews prior to our trip and try to take reviews with a grain of salt but mark my words….we should have heeded the multiple warnings!!!  When you look at enterprise, budget, hertz and other big name REPUTABLE rental services it seemed like their prices were so much higher!!!  After you add the extra fees from fox there were no savings.  Same price when you they add the hidden fees and HORRIBLE customer service!!! HORRIBLE!!!

"AVOID!!!! (Booked in my partners name Phillip) before it's said I had no booking...Our flight was delayed to the next day due to covid requirements changing at the last minute. We informed both Fox rental cars in San Francisco and Wise cars who we booked our rental car through. Wise cars said it's fine they've added an additional 24hrs to our booking. Fox said it's fine, inform Wise Cars.Arrived to Fox rental in San Francisco after 1.5hrs extra sat on the runway due to the plane needing de-icing before arrival at Heathrow. Plus the hour wait from passport control San Francisco end. We finally made it (within the 24hrs). Fox told us Wise cars told them we had 12 hours not 24hrs, our booking has expired and we need to pay for a brand new rental car!What?! Every car rental company asks for a flight number. The reason being if its late they know and can accommodate as much as they can with the vehicle you booked. Not steal your money and make you pay again. We were never a 'no show'.Both companies had our flight numbers so knew we would be later for reasons well beyond our control. Why bother asking for it if you are going to just cancel our booking and keep our money?!!!!We argued we had 24hrs and this was shown to Fox in an email from Wise cars to us. We also called Wise cars infront of the Fox desk man, and they spoke. The Fox rental guy said 'oh its been 25hrs now anyway' so we can't have a car unless we pay again! What a liar!We were absolutely shocked. After a long flight, delays beyond our control, we'd done everything we could have done, both knew our flight numbers so if they took the time they would see our flight delay, stood there with a baby and young child, we were left no option but to pay again. So the initial rental car was £814. Fox said they would match our previous booking. We then paid another £814 and they said we don't have insurance... We said under our previous booking we paid for all extras, including insurance and showed our email confirmation receipt.He had the cheek to say its not on his system, we never had it!!!! So of course we has to pay an additional £447. Totally disgusted.At the end of the day we had done nothing wrong. The two companies misinformation and lack of checking the flight arrivals has cost us a lot of money. Never use Fox rental cars or Wise cars in the UK.

"Same experience as others. Fox has twice now done the same thing with reservations: what we reserved was not available and we had to pay a significant ""upsell"" price to get a vehicle that would fit luggage, 3 adults and 2 infants in car seats. This happened at Fort Myers in 2018 and again at Phoenix in 2021. This is their policy and practice it seems.

"I would give 0 stars if I could. We reserved a ""Compact SUV"" via Expedia for $451.22 total for a week; when I made the reservation it said clearly that this was a 4 door SUV for 5 passengers, 3 pieces of luggage, and 3 carryons. I even took a screenshot of the reservation but then (stupid me) forgot to print it out and did not bring the device with the screenshot on the trip. Boy do I regret that. When we got to the Fox counter, the agent insisted that we had reserved a 2-door Jeep that had no space at all for luggage - way too small for the 5 adults in our group - and when I tried to pull up the Expedia reservation to prove what I had reserved, it only had the info ""Jeep Compass or similar"" and ""5 passengers"". Agent named Angel continued to gaslight me and insist that we had reserved ""their smallest most compact vehicle"" and because I was not able to get Expedia on the phone while standing at the desk, we ended up getting charged an additional ~$500 for an ""upgrade"" to (basically) the vehicle I had originally reserved. Our $451 rental ended up being over $1000. I called Expedia when we got back from the trip, and the CS rep was very sympathetic and promised to work on resolving this and getting a refund, but I don't have a lot of hope given other reviews I've read on this site. Still waiting to hear back from Expedia.

"Folks, please do your research before EVER renting a car from this company. My partner and I arrived on a vacation in CA in early December 2021 and took a taxi to our hotel. We knew what activities we planned to see and thought it might be cheaper to rent a car. We checked online and although we are familiar with Enterprise, as we had used them plenty of times in the past, we decided to go with Fox rental because of their rate. We paid online, but once we arrived to pick up the car, the trouble started and I should have listened to my ""spidey sense."" Problem 1: We had to pay for supplemental liability insurance, after already purchasing insurance once we reserved the car.Problem 2: We had to pay a $150 deposit on the car with a credit card, when we didn't see that listed when we reserved the vehicle. Problem 3: They tried to upsell a few things, one thing that stood out had to do with the gasoline. They said it is $4.70ish to fill up in CA now, but that they could give us a $4.90 rate, so we didn't pay as much. We quickly turned that down as we our Costco members and knew we would fill up there for a discount. The car was some 4 door basic vehicle, that took a while to heat up but ran and that was all that we needed. The night before we left we stopped by a Costco 5 minutes from our hotel to fill up, we overfilled a bit and it only cost $15. The next day we drive to the airport ( 10 minutes away from the hotel) to return the car 2 hours early. A tech ( his name is Luis, and yep we are putting people on blast for this post) checked us in, took the car and we went downstairs because I wanted to ask a rep about our deposit return. Easy, peasy, right?We were told that the deposit should be credited back right away, that's all and I felt a bit uneasy with that answer, as if there was something that she left unsaid. As we go through TSA, my boyfriend gets an email from Fox rental, basically it shows that they were keeping $141 of my $150 deposit. As it was too late to go back, I figured I would deal with it when we returned home. At home, I reached out to their customer service line ( be prepared to hold and hold some more), I spoke to an agent, gave her the pertinent information and asked why they decided to keep my deposit and we were told because we returned the car empty and were charged almost $100 for fuel lol. A few problems with that; the car couldn't hold $100 in fuel, so what the heck and gas is $4.70ish in CA so how did they come up with that number. I knew my deposit was going to be returned so I was very calm with the agent and told her that we filled up at Costco the night before and have the receipt for that and that we also ( surprise) took a picture of the gas tank/ mileage on the morning that we drove to the airport. All time stamped and all would show that there was no way that the car was returned empty. She asked me to email that information over, which I did and 2 days later I was reimbursed 126.64 ( the insurance total of 23.26 wouldn't be returned, understandably).I want to thank the rep Andrea, for resolving this quickly. I want to again say Luis is a terrible person and a liar. How many other people have they pulled this scam on? People who didn't take a picture or have a gas receipt were definitely screwed over. Also Valerie the customer service rep tried ""hard to be helpful"" during pick up but she should have given us more information and told us more about their insurance options that they forced upon us. Valuable lesson learned, stay away from real foxes as well as Fox rental. Folks if you must rent from them, again.... ALWAYS take a picture of the gas mileage and the outside of the vehicle ( heck, they may say you got into an accident and force you to purchase their company a new car) and keep your receipts- anything relating to the gas, tolls, etc without those pics they probably won't care about your picture.",1,US,2021-12-26,Negative,folk please research ever rent car company partner arrive vacation can early december take taxi hotel know activity plan see thought might cheap rent car check online although familiar enterprise use plenty time past decide go fox rental rate pay online arrive pick car trouble start listen spidey sense problem pay supplemental liability insurance already purchase insurance reserve carproblem pay deposit car credit card do not see list reserve vehicle problem try upsell thing one thing stand gasoline say ish fill can could give we rate do not pay much quickly turn costco member know would fill discount car door basic vehicle take heat run need night leave stop costco minute hotel fill overfill bit cost next day drive airport minute away hotel return car hour early tech name luis yep put people blast post check we take car go downstairs want ask rep deposit return easy peasy rightwe tell deposit credit back right away that s feel bit uneasy answer something leave unsaid go tsa boyfriend get email fox rental basically show keep deposit late go back figure would deal return home home reach customer service line prepare hold hold speak agent give pertinent information ask decide keep deposit tell return car empty charge almost fuel lol problem car could not hold fuel heck gas ish can come number know deposit going return calm agent tell fill costco night receipt also surprise take picture gas tank mileage morning drive airport time stamp would show way car return empty ask email information day later reimburse insurance total would not return understandablyi want thank rep andrea resolve quickly want say luis terrible person liar many people pull scam people do not take picture gas receipt definitely screw also valerie customer service rep try hard helpful pick give we information tell we insurance option force upon we valuable lesson learn stay away real fox well fox rental folk must rent always take picture gas mileage outside vehicle heck may say get accident force purchase company new car keep receipt anything relate gas toll etc without pic probably will not care picture,26,December,2021

"It was almost great! But I'll say that overall was very good. Just felt disappointed with some things - The car was smelling pretty bad, like cigar/cigarettes, I don't feel like the car had been clean before we use it. Also, we found a MOUSE in the car - the first day ate a piece of our chocolate one day, we couldn't figure out what it was so in the second day, me and my husband had just parked the car and I saw the mouse running up in my arm - we got off the car and spend like 20 minutes trying to get it off the car - it was a small mouse and it was afraid to jump from the car, I suspect that it was probably born there, I really don't think it could have jumped in. It worries me because, if it had crawled in our legs while we were driving we could have crash or something. We know it was already in the car when we got it because we hadn't open the windows of the car in the first days and we used few times. When delivering the car back, we told the guy that there was a mouse there and that the car had strong cigars smell, he said he would talk to the manager to see if he could give us a discount but today I see that they charged the regular amount with no discounts.

"Having just returned from Los Angeles i can completely empathize with everything that has been written about this car rental company.I bought my C.D.W in the  U.K and informed the agent at the desk that i declined all insurances.Quite obviously my request fell on deaf ears as a couple of days later i looked at the agreement and saw that i had been charged for C.W.D  and S.L.i. inclusively.Finding it impossible to contact them by phone,i had to drive back to L.A.X and inform another agent what i had been charged.He asked to see proof of my U.k policy which i showed him.He then told me that he would remove the insurance that i already had bought in the U.K.but it was the law in California that i needed to have the Supplemental liability insurance so i agreed to leave that insurance on.On my last day in the U.s.a i looked at the agreement again and saw that he'd left the C.D.W on and taken the S.L.I off!!!  So basically, the insurance that he said i needed by law was removed and the insurance i already had he left on.On a more positive note after contacting Fox Car Rental by Facebook (the best way) i was lucky enough to be helped by someone who sorted the whole mess out for me in a very professional manner, the complete opposite of the 2 guys at the rental desk who,s main job it would seem is to add on as many insurances as they can either with your approval or not.So,if you want a smooth trouble free experience on your next car rental in the U.s.a then my advice is to stay well clear  in my opinion of this greedy, dishonest,car rental company.You'll save yourself a lot of stress by going with someone else.",1,CA,2021-11-30,Negative,return los angeles completely empathize everything write car rental companyi buy cdw uk inform agent desk decline insurancesquite obviously request fall deaf ear couple day later look agreement see charge cwd sli inclusivelyfinde impossible contact phonei drive back lax inform another agent chargedhe ask see proof uk policy show himhe tell would remove insurance already buy ukbut law california need supplemental liability insurance agree leave insurance onon last day usa look agreement see he d left cdw take sli basically insurance say need law remove insurance already leave onon positive note contact fox car rental facebook good way lucky enough help someone sort whole mess professional manner complete opposite guy rental desk who s main job would seem add many insurance either approval notsoif want smooth trouble free experience next car rental usa advice stay well clear opinion greedy dishonestcar rental companyyoull save lot stress go someone else,30,November,2021

"I rented a car from the company from November 7-13, 2021. I booked the rental through Expedia.com. When I booked the rental, the total cost is only $539.06.  After all the unnecessary charges the staff at the counter that I was forced to accept because of the made-up threats he made which I will expound later, the total cost shot up to $858.67.  Included in my booking with Expedia is collision damage plan worth $70 for the whole duration of the rental. When I came to pick up the car, the staff told me that the insurance I paid with Expedia does not cover the statutory limits provided by law. He made me pay for Supplemental Liability Insurance worth another $70.08 and Rental Liability Insurance worth another $83.94. When I searched online about this insurance coverage, the Expedia collision damage plan is already the same as the Supplemental Liability Insurance. This is clearly a deceitful, predatory and unfair practice of this business. In addition, he also forced me to purchase the Plate Pass worth $11.99 per day which he told me is for the toll fees. According to him, if I don't purchase the Plate Pass, and a bill for toll charges is sent to the company after the rental period, Fox would charge me $90 for each incidence of toll fee.  And this is why I agreed.But since it would cost $71.94 for the entire rental period, I asked him: ""What if I don't use any roads with toll fees on some days, will I be refunded for those days that I don't use roads with toll fees?"" He told me: ""Yes, you will be refunded"". During the 6 day rental period, we only used a road with toll fees once, when we went to Desert Hills Premium Outlets. So when I returned the car on the 5th day (shortened rental period), I asked the front desk staff whether I will be refunded for the days of the Plate Pass that I did not use any toll road (5 days total), the staff told me that there is no refund. So again, I was deceived by the staff who attended to me when I picked up the car about the refund for the Plate Pass. These unfair and predatory business practices of Fox Rent A Car should be stopped and they should be civilly liable for these deceitful practices. The name of the staff who attended to me when I picked up the car is Olufemi. The rental agreement only has his first name. Many tourists are not aware of the regulations of the country they are visiting. Businesses should not take advantage of this lack of knowledge to dupe them into accepting unnecessary fees.  I already reported this incident to the Better Business Bureau for resolution.  Aside from refund, I was also requesting from the Better Business Bureau that rental companies should already disclose all fees on the booking website.  I rented a car from Hertz on my first 3 days in Los Angeles (before going to Las Vegas and Aspen.  From Aspen, we came back to Los Angeles and rented from Fox.), Hertz did not charge any additional fees without proper disclosure.  They also did not offer any Plate Pass or any electronic payments for toll fees.  So the final cost of the rental almost did not differ with the cost stated on my Expedia booking.  What I learned from this experience is that by trying to save money by going to the so-called ""lower cost"" or ""budget-friendly"" establishments, you will end up paying more than what you would pay the ""high-quality, excellent service"" companies because the cost on the booking website is just another predatory tool to lure customers to book with them but they will charge you all kinds of unnecessary fees!

"Why you should pay a little bit more for another rental cars companies and avoid the FOX rent-a-car.Here is the story from our last Colorado visit.It started at the Denver International Airport.In the spot, there was a group of people waited the shuttle. We saw all diff shuttles but FOX. After about 20 mins of waiting sporadically, we started to call FOX. An about 10 mins later a shuttle arrived.The way to the facility took about 15+ mins (no front desk at Denver Internation Airport).When we came to the front desk, the representative suggested updating the car to 4x4. The upgrade price is supposed to raise about $200 extra. We declined that option.The representative mentioned that it is a ""bad"" choice not to take the 4x4 option. We weren't paying attention to that until we headed the road. We've got an SUV with more than 67K miles. We had our first destination in Vail, Co. Just for reference, In AZ, NV, and other places in the USA and overseas we mostly used 2WD cars with no issues in different weather and surface conditions. So we didn't expect something unusual in CO too.The 2nd issue we've got was when we were on highway 70 and couldn't speed up from 50 m/hr up. Even when the accelerator was pushed to the floor level. To the Vail we were on the right lane and semi-tracks were passed us (it was dangerous and scared, because of the weather condition on 10/12/2021 (rain and snow)).For the record, when the car drove downhill we were able to get to 75 m/hr as per speed limit with no issues. There was a huge issue getting to the speed limit on any uphill road even in Denver, CO.The 3rd issue we found was when the back-view camera showed the image upside down. It was in the same unpleasant weather condition and just personal driving experience helped us. The safety-first wasn't in the car at all.Then we've got a low-pressure sign on the dashboard. The valet fulfilled the tires. We were lucky to have that service in the resort so we used it more than once when we stayed there. Another safety issue with the car for renters.A few times the back-view camera stopped working at all and was flashing when the reverse gear was used.When we returned the car the guy on reception looked described issues and told us that probably that car shouldn't go out at all.The FOX rental car company uses outdated, not safe and not so clean cars with a lot of mileage.

"Before writing this review  I tried  to reach Fox customer service on phone and I even sent them several letters but all without any success. I wasn’t able to reach them on phone and they haven’t answered my letters ever. I rented a car from Fox Fort Myers’ office last Saturday (RA: RSW- 215949).

Instead they told me that the agreement would be sent me by email. It was a long line after me, so unfortunately I accepted this as I trusted them and thought that the agreement would be in order with my booking. When at home I checked the agreement, I realized that the estimated costs were 445,72 USD instead of  289 USD. They added 7 days ATS - tolls (83,93 USD), pre-paid fuel (52,12 USD) and some other fees I don’t understand at all. I never asked for anything of this. I told them that I would stay at the same town, so I don’t need PlatePass at all. They never asked me about pre-paid fuel.

"My fiancé and I went to California.  We rented a car from Fox at LAX.  We drove the car to Bakersfield, CA.  That night our catalytic converter was stolen off of our rental.  We called the company, and they were wonderful about bringing us a new rental (brought us a new rental from LAX and towed the broken car back), and we were assured that we would NOT have to pay for the tow.  We used my insurance to take care of the repair, and went on our merry way.  We had to pay a $350 “administrative fee” that our insurance didn’t cover, and were told the claim was closed.  Now we received a bill for $818.00 for the tow.  I called the company and was told there were no notes about FOX paying for the tow in the account, and the “quality assurance” tapes were no longer available; we are required to pay the money or be sent to collections.  Well, we want to fight this on the principle.  It is absolutely unacceptable to say something is covered, and then charge for the service.

"Will never use again! Customer Service from Management was unacceptable. I rented a car from SFO which is inconveniently OFF SITE of the airport, realised after stepping off the shuttle van that I had left my prescription sunglasses on the passenger seat back at FOX. I rang immediately and got no reply to Lost and Found - if it had been on the SFO location I could've retrieved them but FOX is 3 miles away and I couldn't walk there to retrieve and make my flight. I emailed and someone finally replied asking what they looked like. I sent a precise photo and then no reply. I had to chase down only for a terse, unprofessional reply from the manager that the car had been returned without any sunglasses. I do not understand how any employee who got in the car to at least inspect it, let alone clean it, did not notice a pair of sunglasses on the seat.

"Let me start by saying I have rented from fox many times and have never been disappointed . I rented this car and feel very lucky I’m alive to emailand complain.  I came here for work on Friday Sept 10. I didn’t want the charger , but it was the only car available .  I was driving back from Murrieta , decided to stop and get gas. I was on a side street about 830pm on Sept 14.  I heard a huge pop  . Within seconds tire pressure gauge appeared and tire was at 18 and quickly went to 12, 9,6 . I pulled over to a lot and it was 2. I called 3 times and waited til 11pm The first girl was ok. The second one, Chris RUDE. ARGUMENTATIVE is an understatement . He argued my wait time. He argued about where I was . How I could still drive on the donut 92 miles to airport til 1230 . They wouldn’t let me call USAA. He argued I needed to buy a tire.  Now remember no service even came. How I should get a hotel. He had not a clue about anything.  I’m in the dark at 11pm during covid with no traffic nothing open with them telling me how by busy they were calling this “3rd party”He was absolutely the most ignorant non understanding customer I’ve ever spoke to. I called again.  This lady she was not as bad but not helpful. At this point im angry. Luckily an oreily delivery driver stopped to help. The jack we had was bent .  I expected to see a tire with road debris . No. Instead I saw a BALD, CRACKED tire plugged multiple times not fit for the road. I thank God it didn’t happen at a high speed.  I truly appreciate the swapping of cars at 3am rather than further wasting my work time the next day as well . I can’t help but wonder the reason was only because the service records were seen at this point and they knew  I had bad dangerous tires it’s obvious the plug popped inside . This car should never have been on the road.  This is what I want. $839 refund today.  If I don’t see the refund I will pursue it legally for extreme negligence as well it was traumatizing to myself and my daughter. Ive already spoken to my local personal Injury lawyer who is also my client . Please Advise ASAP when refund will be  appearing.

"Well, I'm currently waiting on the customer service line, have been transferred twice and its going on an hour.They charged me for a full tank of gas at 126.00, when in fact we filled the tank up at 6 miles left to the car rental.

The refund comment sounded strange, so at the airport got the email with the extra charge of over 126.00 for the 7.99 a gallon. Really? so I returned a rental car with a completely empty tank???

"I rented my car at Fox rental car through Expedia. My agreement with Expedia was $485 for Premier SUV for 11 days. I live in New Jersey I was flying to LAX. When I arrived at Fox rental at LAX airport (1:20) my pick up time through Expedia was for 12 PM, There is a three hour window. Hold on because here it comes, Fox rental had 10 AM. Which put me outside of that three hour window according to fox rental. They did not have my agreed-upon vehicle and I was forced to rent a Dodge Caravan for a much higher rate!!!! I believe when they realized I had a vehicle for $485 for 11 days they quickly decided to rent my SUV for much more than my agreement.

"This review is for Denver Airport Fox Car Rental.I did an online booking for Fox, I knew they had very poor reviews but against my better judgement booked anyway. This was a $332.39 mistake.I booked a intermediate SUV (Rogue, Rav4 or similar)after waiting in line 45 minutes it was my turn. I've rented many cars in my lifetime so I knew the routine.The guy doing the paperwork (Christopher) seemed pretty nice. He mentions they have plenty of cars and can upgrade me to a 4 Runner for same price as the small SUV. Me ""same price?"" Yes, same price you booked online. Here's where the incident happens. Yes, it was the same price as the small SUV but it was added to the price of the small SUV I booked.So a $415 one week rental turned into $748!Their paperwork is very confusing, where you sign, it says ""Minumum.7 days @32.48/day not to exceed $280. That's great I thought, that's the online price. So then you sign the paper copy and a couple electronic pads that you really don't know what your signing.Then he presents another paper that shows the charge breakdown. I look at the list and see $280 for the small SUV and down the list I see another $280 that says upgrade @$40x7days=$280 with taxes and fees adds up to $748.33. I enquired about the $748, he was very hard to understand with the loud ambient noise and mask on. (they use this to their advantage)I heard him say ""don't worry that will drop off when you bring the car back"" Okay, I had security deposits on car rentals promptly returned, no problem. So I signed the doc.Later that day I was looking at the receipt  thinking something's not right here so I called ""customer service"" After the usual press1 press3 press# I get annoying  music. Now, here I'm on a pleasure trip sitting in a coffee shop with my phone, the line open for 1hour 45 minutes. Guess What? Disconnected!Tried few hours later, nada..Next day..nada. Zero customer service!!This transaction went seemingly so smooth, I'm sure the counter reps are trained how to drain every penny out of tired, hurried travelers. Please read all the one star reviews! Make a smart decision, don't use Fox to save a buck it will cost you far more than you think.!  P.S. The 4runner was the worst vehicle I ever rented. Filthy inside and out, AND dangerous.

After I declined everything, he tried to sneak in extra insurance.  He did sell me on upgrading to another vehicle, mostly because it had navigation.  We were traveling to some areas where cell reception was going to be spotty, so I thought this was worth the money.  Once I was in the vehicle, I quickly discovered it had no navigation.Then, the CarPlay, which was our only other source of navigation stopped working and I could not reconnect to it.Now, we have a big crack in our front windshield and I can't get anyone to discuss the matter with.

I after I refused to pay, they sent me to collections, then when I wrote them a letter explaining and sending them a check for the total tolls and 15% for administrative fees, they still wouldn't budge and continued to send collections after me for the full $60 in administrative fees.

I have $360 of charges which just do not add up, even including the insurance I didn't ask for or want.

As we did not want to wait for 45 mins and wanted to avoid the San Diego traffic if possible, we felt as if we had no choice.

"Fox Rent a Car is the WORST! DO NOT RENT WITH THEM!!when we arrived to pick up the vehicle on Thursday, June 3, 2021, the seller who attended me refused to give me the car unless I took out Liability insurance that according to him it was ""mandatory"" in the state of Florida, which is a LIE, the man insisted and lying, refused to give me the car unless I agreed to take out the insurance, I had to accept it, paying an extra 156 dollars to the rent of the vehicle, in addition there was no discount for reducing the rent for one day and the man was VERY insistent that he did not have to deliver the vehicle with a full tank so that they could charge me the extra gasoline, noting it in the lease Attached, after leaving the rent a car I found out about the insurance and they told me that it is NOT mandatory, that the agent lied to me.

"We rented a 2020 Elantra SEL for six days for a total of $193.33 at the Fox Rent A Car, SFO Airport. (Note:  Thrifty was going to charge $630.25 for six day car rental.)  To get to Fox Rent A Car from SFO Airport, you need take the Blue Line Air Train from the terminal to the Rental Car Center. Upon arrival at the rental car center, follow the signs to shuttle island 2 outside the building (a bit of a walk) and wait for the Fox shuttle bus to go to their off airport rental counter.  Once we arrived at the rental counter, we waited a very long time because people ahead of us were having some problems.  Once we got the car keys, we documented all the scratch and dents on the car (took pictures of everything including their document).  Make sure you do not overlook this step.  ALERT:  Cars rented from Fox are equipped with a PlatePass device on the front windshield. They are going to try and sell you the optional PlatePass All-Inclusive service at $11.99+tax per rental day (max. 15 day charge), which covers all electronic tollways and bridges. They also tell you if you choose not to purchase the optional  PlatePass All-Include service at the commencement of your rental and you utilize a PlatePass Toll Road, then you will be charge a $15.00 admin fee per toll ($90.00 maximum per rental agreement) plus the price of the toll and fees from the tolling authority.  We optioned NOT to take the PlatePass All-Inclusive service and instead connected our Android phone to the car display/monitor and used the phone GPS system to avoid all toll roads.  FYI: The Golden Gate Bridge does not charge a toll if you are heading north out of San Francisco (it does charge a toll if you are heading into San Francisco).  Choosing to avoid toll roads only added about 40 minutes to our drive from Napa Valley back to the SFO airport area (routed us through San Jose).",3,US,2021-06-21,Neutral,rent elantra sel six day total fox rent car sfo airport note thrifty going charge six day car rental get fox rent car sfo airport need take blue line air train terminal rental car center upon arrival rental car center follow sign shuttle island outside building bit walk wait fox shuttle bus go airport rental counter arrive rental counter wait long time people ahead we problem get car key document scratch dent car take picture everything include document make sure overlook step alert car rent fox equip platepass device front windshield go try sell optional platepass allinclusive service tax per rental day max day charge cover electronic tollway bridge also tell choose purchase optional platepass allinclude service commencement rental utilize platepass toll road charge admin fee per toll maximum per rental agreement plus price toll fee tolling authority optione take platepass allinclusive service instead connect android phone car displaymonitor use phone gps system avoid toll road fyi golden gate bridge charge toll head north san francisco charge toll head san francisco choosing avoid toll road add minute drive napa valley back sfo airport area route us san jose,21,June,2021

"Upon my prepaid rental pickup for an suv (that I already paid $650 in February) the woman at the desk (Deonica) told me that an upgrade would be an extra “$250” for which I interpreted it as $250 total cost and come to find out she charged me $250/ day for 10 days and never specified any of this and never told me the total. She then proceeded to tell me to “Scroll through and sign” the screens on the tab lying about what they were stating so I wouldn’t notice the extra $4600 she charged me.  I also declined all additional coverage on the car and she continued to charge me for every additional coverage they offer at Fox and lie to me! She knew I had small children who were sick and waiting in the 95 degree heat (per Fox policy that the children had to wait outside,) and she took advantage of me.When I noticed how much she charged me I brought the car back the next day (as I was in the hospital with my child,) I stated how unbelievably dishonest as well as completely slimy that situation was and I was returning the car and wanted my money back. I agreed to pay for the 1 day that I had the car as I should have not trusted her and gone through everything more carefully sooner.  This women Deonica who said she is the manager said she would take the car back but she had to charge me for all the fees she illegally charged me and 2 days with the car which came to $1243!

"I rented a car from FOX in Seattle, Wa.  I had rented from them before, not by choice, I usually use a third party like Priceline.  They don't have the best counter Customer Service, but usually have good rates.  I had rented a Dodge Caravan and it worked well for my family of adults.  At the beginning of the trip, not long after getting the rental car, it was noticed that the middle seats almost had an ejection latch, they violently flung up to let the people in the back out.  At a stop I was lifting the latch to let out the back passengers having control of the seat, my hand was up by the headrest.  The headrest violently flung down on my pinkie finger, catching it and at that point I let go of the seat from pain.  The seat had broke my finger!!!  When returning the car, I told the young man what happened and it seemed like that was not the first time he'd heard something like that.  I did go on line and responded to 2 separate surveys, 1 from FOX and the other from Priceline indicating what had happened.  That was almost a month ago and still no response from either survey!!!

Mind you, this was a prepaid; I'm standing there respectfully trying to speak to the woman, who tells me despite having a roundtrip ticket and being pre-booked; I can NOT rent from them. Then she demanded I leave their office to which I harshly retorted ""NO, it's hot outside and the shuttle isn't here"". She threatened to call the cops, I said go ahead; and we can have a strong record of what just went down when I get in contact with corporate...she backed down.I then had to carry everything back outside to the shuttle, and wander around the terminal from rental place to rental place...after almost an hour roaming around and browsing the web; I finally found 1 that had a few cars even with all the graduations going on.I contacted corporate a few times, and still received no response.

"If I could give this zero stars I would. Booked online through Expedia and was impressed with the rates. I should have known it was to good to be true. The price was double then what I reserved the vehicle for. When questioning the price at pick up, I was told that it was pricier due to the deposit and that I would get the money back upon return. The gentleman working couldn’t break down the price to tell us the exact numbers. We were not given the vehicle we originally reserved. Once we got in the car, the vehicle had a strong smoke/weed smell. At the time, it was something I thought I could deal with (as I’m not one to complain). What set me over the edge and what prompted me to write the review was that on the last day we had the vehicle, my husband found a bag of weed in the car while cleaning out our trash. The vehicle was rented out of Florida where it is currently illegal. When addressing the issue when dropping off the car we were told “it’s only a $250 fine”.

Terrible.  Don't rent from these folks.  I gurantee that whatever you are quoted your final invoice will be doubled.  I went in with a quoted price of 316 with a 72 dollar fee to pay when i picked up (and a 200 dollar deposit).  These folks tack on so many hidden charges and rattle away all sorts of nonsense at pickup that I ended up with a 676 dollar invoice.  The man at the desk claimed it was cheaper to do pre-paid gas but failed to mention that even if i brought the car back at 3/4s full that they would charge the full amount.  He added in a second insurance that I did not need.  Go with one of the other well known car rentals and not this company.

To start with we had over a 2 hour wait in line to get the car. Very disappointed in the time it took people to go though their process then had to go out the garage and wait again. A rock hit the windshield on the way back to the terminal. We notified the attendee and filled out the paperwork required with our insurance information. Received a calles from Fox 5 days after returning home that we needed to pay the amount and file through the insurance ourselves which is no problem.  When I received the email with the charge from the glass company it was different than what I was charged.  When I calles to ask about it the customer service rep was very rude. For someone who is dealing with people she needs a more people skills.  When she asked for the claim number and I didn't have it she told me to call back when I had it. I told her no to just hang on a second. She told me she had other people calling and again I could call back. She also informed I should have had an itemized receipt with all the charges. She was adamant that I should have has it in the email I received. When she looked at the email she had not sent it. There was an addition $75 dollar charge for process the claim.

Just rented from fox.Made the reservation on line through Europe at which I was not aware that it bought Fox and subsequently would be picking up the vehicle fro fox.I have had bad experiences with the Salt Lake City locations in the with charges and dirty smelly cars.For that reason I do not rent from fox.This particular time I was not aware that europcar at the time of prepared reservation made that it would be fox.Since I had prepaid with the conditions of no refunds or date changes allowed or for not using the reservation I had to go through with the reservation.Not only is their shuttle filthy their cars are also filthy foul smelling and they overcharge you additions to the already agreed price online reservation. If you complain of the the vehicles condition and request for clean car they make you feel like you should except the car and asking for too much.So overall their customer and vehicles are very poor.Now it may be that I am the few that seems to have luck bad luck that is but I will never knowingly rent from FOX at least not Salt Lake City.They make so difficult to talk to someone about your concerns or disputes they never answer the phone or give u an option for call back.,1,US,2021-04-29,Negative,rent foxmade reservation line europe aware buy fox subsequently would pick vehicle fro foxi bad experience salt lake city location charge dirty smelly carsfor reason rent foxthis particular time aware europcar time prepare reservation make would foxsince prepaid condition refund date change allow use reservation go reservationnot shuttle filthy car also filthy foul smell overcharge addition already agree price online reservation complain vehicle condition request clean car make feel like except car ask muchso overall customer vehicle poornow may seem luck bad luck never knowingly rent fox least salt lake citythey make difficult talk someone concern dispute never answer phone give u option call back,29,April,2021

"We are senior citizens that travel a lot and have rented cars many times. I have rented from Fox several times in the past and always been satisfied. I rented from the (off airport) facility in Orlando from April 9-19, 2021 and was very unhappy. It was actually the worst car rental experience I have ever had.First, we agreed to rent a full size car which Fox describes as for 5 adults and 4 bags, Toyota Camry or similar. Upon check in, we were assigned (not pick any car from a certain row as in the past) a Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross, which has the distinction as the worst automobile I have ever drove. I am 6'3"" and when the seat was all the way back, it was comfortable for my 5'4"" wife, but not at all comfortable for me. There is no leg room (side to side) in the front.When we tried to put our suitcases in, we had to fold the rear seat down to get 2 (airline legal) standard suitcases in the rear. This is not a full sized car, useable for 5 adults and  4 bags, or certainly not a car that should be compared with a Toyota Camry in size, or any other way!When we opened up the door, the first thing my wife said was this car hasn't been cleaned. After examining it, I would say partially cleaned. It appears that it had been vacuumed, but nothing else. We actually had to stop and clean the inside of the windshield, because the sun was glaring off the dirty glass so bad that we couldn't see. Maybe that would have been acceptable in the past, but during COVID, it is totally unacceptable. As I said, I have rented from Fox several times in the past. I probably won't consider Fox in the future.",1,US,2021-04-20,Negative,senior citizen travel lot rent car many time rent fox several time past always satisfied rent airport facility orlando april unhappy actually bad car rental experience ever hadfirst agree rent full size car fox describe adult bag toyota camry similar upon check assign pick car certain row past mitsubishi eclipse cross distinction bad automobile ever drive seat way back comfortable wife comfortable leg room side side frontwhen try put suitcase fold rear seat get airline legal standard suitcase rear full sized car useable adult bag certainly car compare toyota camry size waywhen open door first thing wife say car have not clean examine would say partially clean appear vacuum nothing else actually stop clean inside windshield sun glare dirty glass bad could not see maybe would acceptable past covid totally unacceptable say rent fox several time past probably will not consider fox future,20,April,2021

"NOT using FOX again. When we arrived at the PHX airport to pick up the vehicle we were checked out by Robert. He was friendly at first. He told us that we would be getting a Dodge Journey. We reserved Hyundai Sante Fe. We asked if there was another vehicle besides the one assigned to us. (I understand similar vehicles. We needed one with the room I have a big teenager and husband) He then proceeds to tell us why the Journey was better than the Sante Fe. We didn't care about why. He then wanted to sell the extra driver, insurance, etc. We told him our insurance covered the rental and no we would not pay the extra for another driver. He still persisted. He basically told us because we the cheap price for the rental we will be getting the Journey. He seemed upset that we booked with a third party and got the price we did. I signed the papers to just get away from him. As I was walking away, I heard him say out loud and snarky about difficult customers. I didn't think we were difficult at all. My husband was tired (it had been a long day our flight has been delayed three hours) and didn't want the Journey. However, my husband's attitude was reflected by the Fox associate's attitude. I don't believe the customer is always right but, the associate can keep his opinions to himself. He can learn to be nicer, politer, and just do his job. He should never speak about customers in front of other customers. He was just rude. Maybe he should learn how to keep his mouth shut and learn better customer service.

"This was BY FAR the worst car rental experience of my life. Nothing even comes close. And it is all attributable to the company. I spent THREE HOURS at the Fox office near Denver airport. 2.5 hours in a huge, snaking line before I even got to the counter, then after completing the paperwork another half hour for the car. This during Covid, in a crowded line with virtually no social distancing possible and plenty of anti-maskers. The employees could give no adequate explanation for the wait. Yes it was a busy Saturday afternoon in spring skiing season. But there were 6 computer terminals at the desk and only 3 of them were manned. The amount of volume couldn’t have been unexpected; there is no excuse. When we finally got the car it was a Mitsubishi Outlander, which was absolutely horrible. I had been promised a Jeep Compass or equivalent. The Outlander was significantly smaller than the Compass (I saw them side to side in a parking lot later in the trip).  The Outlander's front wheel drive had horrible traction that gave me trouble on snow several times.  Also, the car was filthy — I have photographs to prove it — with a huge, gross, spilled-coffee stain right next to the steering wheel (should have been impossible to miss for anyone cleaning the car). I typically try for the best price for a car rental, all other things being equal. This horrific experience made it clear that all other things are NOT equal.

I had no power to keep my phone charged to call half the week or check my email but still attempted to get in touch with someone from your company. All hwys were closed in San Antonio so there was no way to return the car. Also the Airport was shutdown several days as well. I was still charged 8 days extra and late fees. I attempted to call to speak with someone when I returned  the car and ran into the same issue of not getting in touch with anyone. Sent two more emails and was generous to wait a week for a response and got nothing back. Oh but wait I got a text for a survey and an email...go figure!! I just honestly wish you would of worked with the individuals that got stranded in Texas due to the weather. I was fine paying for the 8 days at the same rate as the two weeks I had the car.

"My experience was very good with Fox Rent a Car. I was concerned after reading the reviews with multiple issues while renting with Fox Rent a Car.  I did purchase the Priority Pass as one of the complaints was a long wait.  This did not save me time on this rental as there was not a line but I will purchase again because if there is a line it would save time. The two issues I would warn customers about is insurance and tolls.  I brought my own transponder for the tolls.  Also, look at your rental agreement before going to your car to make sure they did not add the insurance if you don't want it.  In my case the insurance was added to the rental agreement without asking. I was also given a summary of charges printed after the rental agreement which did not have the insurance on it.  I did not notice this until a few days into my rental.  I called the customer service number, on hold for 45 minutes, and was told they could not take it off and only the location could, but would put a note on my account. When I returned the vehicle I said to not close the rental agreement until I talked with a manger about the insurance. I was sent inside and was able to get the insurance taken off because of the summary of charges I received without the insurance and the fact I had called in. Would have been a lot easier to look at the actual rental agreement and address the issue right away.The vehicle I received was clean and in good driving condition.I definitely will rent with Fox Rent a Car in the future based on this experience.The shuttle driver was very helpful in loading and unloading our luggage and gave us directions to the airline we were traveling on.

In addition, he was on his mobile phone on a personal call while belittling my husband.  My husband also noticed several cars where dented and scratched.

"This is my 1st time using Fox car rental and is also the last time for sure. It’s not exaggerating to say Fox is the worst company of any kinds by far I have ever dealt in my 30+ years travel history.1.	It took almost 3 hours to get the car: more than 2 hours waiting in the line and additional 40 minutes for the car to be ready. This did not include about 30 min waiting for the shuttle. When the shuttle was finally coming, it is small, old and dirty, nowhere close to those of other companies that had come and gone at least 4 times during my waiting. 2.	The price shown at Rentalcars.com is a trap. I ended up paid more than twice the reservation price because they said the small 2WD Mitsubishi Outlander Sports is the similar car to Jeep Grand Cherokee I booked. The retail price of Grand Cherokee is almost twice that of Outlander Sports. I had to pay a large amount of extra to get a slightly larger AWD car. Other companies also play the same trick but none to this extreme. I rented a Nissan Maxima from Avis before. They gave me a Chrysler 300. It was not what I wanted but not far off. Regulators should crack down this practice to force rental company list all their “similar” cars. 3.	The car I finally got had several serious problems. The right-side head light was not on. The “low tire pressure” light initiated after about 5-mile drive. The driver side wipe is in such bad condition that the windshield was completely blocked after anti-freeze wash. I had to stop at an auto part store to replace the wipe blander myself. I haven’t mention that the car was very dirty and had 90,000 miles on it. 4.	The staff are rude and unfriendly. They tried hard to sell you various of useless items. For example, a toll pass costs $17 a day. Colorado doesn’t have toll road. Only car pool lanes around Denver area used to charged fees but no longer now.I regret that I didn’t check reviews. It is the lowest rated company. Its high score reviews are most likely fakes. When I was returning the car, I saw two other customers were complaining.

If I could give a zero I would. This company has more underlying fees and rip off policies the discount isn't worth it. Trust me your credit or bank account will be messed up if you rent from them. If you aren't pleased they are not willing to give a refund. If you cancel after booking you just loose your money. They are misleading the customers with the security deposit. Instead of them out right saying that they are charging $500. It first states that you need $150 for the deposit then ar the end of all these other states it has the $500 cost but the way that its posted looks like certain states only pays $150. They are charging some people $150 and others $500. I contacted customer service via email after posting my first site review and I got nothing but the cold shoulder and the same misleading post that is at the counter and on the website. I'm so happy that the Representative responded in his own words if you return the vehicle there are no refunds. The vehicle that I have is swaying in the rear-end and I believe that it is the tires. Feels like the belts are broken in the tire. Please please don't rent not a door knob from these people.

"Fox Rental Cars: After doing my research on rental car companies in Puerto Vallarta to make sure I picked a reliable company, I reserved a Full Size Van for my group of 12 people, I even called to talk with someone to make sure that is what we were getting.  When we arrived they told us they didn't have any full size vans! They gave us a Minivan instead, so half of our group had to take a Taxi.  we drove 6 miles down the road and the minivan broke down, so they came to us with a Suzuki SUV, which can only hold 4 people with luggage or 6 without luggage, so we had to call another cab.  This might not be such a big deal if we were staying close to town, but the house we rented was in Marina Chacala, a 2 hour drive north of Puerto Vallarta.  We ended up spending more on Taxi's than we spend on the rental car plus we still had to pay full price for a little economy car, they would not adjust the price when we checked out.  I would never recommend this company to anyone and don't get me started on their insurance scam, steer clear of these people!!!

"Fox Rent a Car at Denver DEN airport.Let me say I made more than 50 car rentals in the USA since 2015 from several companies and I noted some bigger or minor issues but this particular location is exceptional - in negative meaning.This time I made reservation thru ""Wisecars"" (for first and last time I believe). Here is briefly my experience:- it takes forever to get to Fox place as they have tiny shuttle that pops up once an hour at airport; others rental places buses pop up every 10-15 minutes!- there was no car as reserved at place upon arrival, had to upgrade what did cost me significantly more comparing to Wisecars voucher- there are number of extra fees listed that must be paid if you want to pickup a car- car was dirty outside and inside, with missing items; looked like sb dropped it a minute before my pickup; fortunately I bought full insurance from rental place what saved me troubles when returning as there was lots of damages on the car under that dirt- Fox facility at DEN is awful - below any acceptable level; seems they try to maximize their profit keeping everything at minimum cost- last but not least - it is not cheap place, renting from them costs same as from Hertz or Avis hence it makes no sense as others have better service and better facilities.I understand there was big load at day I was over there but this is not a good excuse as i.e. NY Kennedy rental places do far better job no matter how busy days are.Finally I must say that front desk people were OK (a lady who serviced me was really helpful) and seemed embarrassed with all that mess.

"Worst car rental experience I have ever had.  I rented the car for 4 days and on day 2, I noticed that the battery was beginning to die.  It was taking longer and longer to turn over every time that I started it.  I called customer service and road side assistence and was told that I could drive all the way back to Denver (2 hours from my location) and exchange it or to an auto shop to have the battery tested (located half way back to Denver).  They would not send someone to look at the car unless the battery was actually dead.  I only needed to start it one more time to get to the airport the following morning but had to leave at 6 am to make it on time.  So I woke up an hour earlier, knowing it wouldn't start, and it didn't.  I called road side assistance to get a jump but was on hold for over 40 min.  Finally had to wake up a random neighbor to help me.  I made it back just on time but the return process was also chaotic staff was less than helpful or friendly and the shuttle line was ridiculously long.

"We rented a car at the Phoenix airport to drive to Yuma. We had a flat tire, and there was NO TIRE IRON OR JACK! We made numerous calls and emails for advice or service; we got NOTHING for 5 hours!!! We didn’t want to drive a car with no jack. We contacted Fox roadside assistance. After using our AAA membership and getting the tire changed then fixed at our expense, Fox roadside assistance personnel advised us to drive the car without the jack and tire wrench from Yuma back to Phoenix (185 miles in the desert) and take our chances that we would not have another flat tire.  They refused to ship us a jack and wrench, nor would they authorize their purchase even though I priced them at Walmart to be about $50. They said that if we have a flat, they would send roadside service. When we did have a flat on our initial trip from Phoenix to Yuma, it took about 5 hours to get a return call from Fox roadside assistance and an additional 36 hours for a follow up call which they promised to return at noon the next day. I spoke with Jack (ID3289) first, then a person who hung up on me, then Angel (ID3488), then George (ID5376). No one would provide a phone number for the Phoenix office or provide an acceptable remedy for driving the car back to Phoenix from Yuma. I simply wanted authorization to buy a jack and wrench at my expense and get reimbursed for the cost. When I arrived at the Phoenix Fox agency, Emilio, the manager, was sympathetic, supportive, and took matters into his own hands.  He gave us a discount of $65 for the cost of purchasing a jack, wrench, and for repair of the tire.

"(a scandal I need to rate 1 star instead of 0 stars, in order to alert all of you!)This is an organized group of professionally trained people, whose aim is to deceive you and steal your money.For the second time in a row, we fell again into this defrauding companyFox rental a car robbed us money and there IS NO WAY to get in contact with anyone: customer service Email (billing at foxrentacar.com, customer centers, ....) Face book,  Websites, call center, …. (they actively use the technique of Ignore, avoid and Denial).Please note that the billing department (billing at foxrentacar.com) has no idea about what happened, so waiting in the line for >30 minutes will just be a waste of your time: Fox Las Vegas swapped the original contract and gave us a different one. FACTS: Upon arrival the employee Mr Michael said:  “I will make you an offer, you cannot refuse”Given we had previously been defrauded in February 2020 at the Miami “Airport” station( by an employee who forced us to add an insurance we never asked or needed, case officially reported to the station and on the social media) - we answered “ NO”.But then he added: “you should trust me, If you return the car empty, it costs you only 3US$ to refuel the car.After returning it with some fuel, we were (obviously) charged for the whole missing fuel. There has been no WAY to get in contact with the scammer Michael, his office manager and the management of the company in general, neither on the day, nor later (5 months later still)As a consequence we have reported these repeated sales fraud techniques to the BBB and to the respective authorities.Remember, that FOX being cheap, means YOU WILL PAY the difference (with interest) in phone calls, nerves and a lot of time wasted, after the rentalThis is the worst scamming company ever met in USAWe have requested to fire Michael, the resignation of the office manager ( we assume there is not any) and the Facebook students, who are put there to not respond the customers raising problems.Note: The company has often asked us to contact billing at foxrentacar.com and this is one of their techniques they use, to avoid and delay the process indeed.Short note on reaching the station:When you land at the airport, there is NO Fox car rental.  You need to wait for a bus at least 20 minutes, drive additional 20 minutes to a station. Still this is NOT where FOX is: you need to wait for a SECOND bus (no air conditioning and no social distancing so to better spread COV19) and after a journey in 120F, you get to their third world location.After that, HELL will begin with FOX Rent a CAR",1,GB,2021-01-10,Negative,scandal need rate star instead star order alert youthis organize group professionally train people whose aim deceive steal moneyfor second time row fall defraud companyfox rental car rob we money way get contact anyone customer service email billing foxrentacarcom customer center face book website call center actively use technique ignore avoid denialplease note billing department billing foxrentacarcom idea happen wait line minute waste time fox las vegas swap original contract give we different one fact upon arrival employee mr michael say make offer refusegiven previously defraud february miami airport station employee force we add insurance never ask need case officially report station social medium answer nobut add trust return car empty cost we refuel carafter return fuel obviously charge whole miss fuel way get contact scammer michael office manager management company general neither day later month later stillas consequence report repeat sale fraud technique bbb respective authoritiesremember fox cheap mean pay difference interest phone call nerve lot time waste rentalthis worst scamme company ever meet usawe request fire michael resignation office manager assume facebook student put respond customer raise problemsnote company often ask we contact billing foxrentacarcom one technique use avoid delay process indeedshort note reach stationwhen land airport fox car rental need wait bus least minute drive additional minute station still fox need wait second bus air conditioning social distancing well spread cov journey f get third world locationafter hell begin fox rent car,10,January,2021

I will never use this company again, the car was very worn and I don't like the fact that I don't have the option to pay my bill without an extortion fee of $15.Update:  I called the # and was able to have the administrative fee waived as a one time courtesy since it was only one charge.

"I have no idea why anyone would rate this company with 4 stars.  They hardly deserve 1 star.  I have rented from this company, and its sister company, Ace, several times, because of their low prices, which are significantly lower than most of the next lowest prices.  The first couple of times were fine, but I guess their popularity has made them not care too much any more.  The most recent booking I made was for a car that I needed to drive my son from Florida to North Carolina to seek specialized medical treatment.  After waiting on line at Hollywood-Ft. Lauderdale airport for over an hour, I get to the reservation desk and the clerk tells me he can't give me the car because due to COVID they are not allowing any cars to go out of state, and that, further, if I drove the car out of state, it would turn itself off and report itself stolen.  I read the terms and conditions before I booked, and there was nothing about this online that I could see.  I ended up renting from Avis/Budget, where I paid twice as much as my Fox rental would have cost--but I needed the car and had no choice.  If I had booked with Budget to begin with, it would have cost more than Fox, but the aggravation would have been far less.The last time, with Ace, they made me buy their extra insurance, citing some regulation that no one else had mentioned, requiring renters to prove that they have $100,000 in coverage.  Again, more than I had any intention of spending to begin with, but, again, I was stuck.I am furious and disgusted, and I will never rent from them again.",1,US,2020-12-22,Negative,idea anyone would rate company star hardly deserve star rent company sister company ace several time low price significantly lower next low price first couple time fine guess popularity make care much recent booking make car need drive son florida north carolina seek specialized medical treatment waiting line hollywoodft lauderdale airport hour get reservation desk clerk tell can not give car due covid allow car go state drive car state would turn report steal read term condition book nothing online could see ended renting avisbudget pay twice much fox rental would costbut need car choice book budget begin would cost fox aggravation would far lessthe last time ace make buy extra insurance cite regulation one else mention require renter prove coverage intention spending begin stucki furious disgust never rent,22,December,2020

"I rented a car from Fox Car rental from the Miami location. The rate for the car was reasonable, so I reserved a vehicle. Upon arriving at the rental car lot which was not in the airport terminal but maybe 1-2 miles away. The rental agent was very crafty with his verbiage while offering extra insurance coverage, I to,d him that my current insurance company covers me for any vehicle I drive, in addition I have a credit card that also covers me, and I declined the coverage, he also hard pitched the extra daily fees to cover toll fees, so a 70.00 rental was estimated to be 150.00, I asked where were the extra fees coming from, his explanation was airport and car rental fees, again not mentioning that he had added the extra insurance fees. Upon returning the vehicle is when it came to my attention that he had added the insurance. I asked them to remove it, and refund those insurance fees, I was told that I needed to call their billing department, at this time they weren’t open due to them having pacific west coast hours and it was 7am east coast time, long story condensed, I called for two days waiting hours in a call que to never reach anyone to have them to refund the overcharge of them adding the insurance that I declined, I got so frustrated that I simply called my credit card company and disputed the overcharge and let then handle it. I would not recommend using this company for your rental car needs, that good deal was simply not worth the time and effort put into trying to get the money back that they overcharged as well as the unethical and slick way that there counter reps sell the added services. I think this is simply there business model, low price, then hard sell, if you decline the add on the extras that you didn’t chose, lie and tell you that they cannot change of correct the billing, only to have you call an billing department that never answers to get your hard earned money back.

"Absolutely the worst rental car experience i have ever had, by far! Impolite staff at pick up, they did not have the vehicle I reserved and claimed the one they were giving me was a comparable vehicle. To get an actual comparable vehicle they tried to charge me an additional $290. Finally gave up and left with the smaller, non 4x4 vehicle. Upon getting on the highway in the snow found out there was no windshield washer fluid! Pulled off and picked some up, then realized the washer spray nozzles shot off to the sides of the car not even hitting the windshield, had to wedge a pen cap under each nozzle to get them to hit the windshield. Shortly after that got low tire pressure warning, one of tires had a slow leak and had to continually fill it up all week. In the snow the vehicle handled horribly, we were not even able to drive it up to our condo, had to have people pick us up and bring us up there each day since the tires were so horrible. Finally on the shuttle back to the airport the shuttle driver tried to cram people into the shuttle ignoring the signs with the closed seats. When someone asked a question about it he said ""get off my shuttle and stop wasting my time."" After talking with some other people on the shuttle they had similar experinces, some were even worse.

"Several years ago I rented from FOX and had a bad experience (dirty car, broken interior parts, etc.) I have them the benefit of the doubt, allowing that it may have been a fluke, and recently rented with them again. Or, should I say, I PAID to rent with them but after arriving on my late-evening flight with my young daughter, I was told they had no more cars left. I was not the only customer to receive this surprising news. There were at least a dozen people in line, who all patiently waited for approximately 30 minutes before the manager FINALLY came out to explain the situation. The manager promised that we would be given refunds and that she would pay for us to take Uber/Lyft to our destinations. She explained that we could return the next day, when they MIGHT have some cars available. Given that I was with my young daughter, that it was 10:00 p.m. and that we were staying 45 minutes from the airport (and only for two nights), returning the next morning only to wait in another long line seemed absurd. The manager then directed me and other pre-paid customers to go ""rent from Budget or Avis."" Luckily, Avis was open and still had cars available. Of course, the cost was more and the FOX manager did not offer to cover the difference. After returning from my trip, I attempted to contact FOX, since I had not seen a reversal of charges on my credit card statement. I called three separate times and had to end the calls due to the extreme wait times. Finally, I just called my credit card company to reverse the charges and to investigate the issue on their own. Since a company cannot charge for a product they did not provide, I'm confident that they will find in my favor. At the end of the day, I am disgusted by FOX and the abysmal customer service and irresponsible business practices. Leaving dozens of customers (several of whom had pre-paid) in the lurch late at night is unconscionable. And, FOX can skip the ""please call customer service"" pat response.

"I used Fox Rent A Car on August 7th in Tampa, FL. I arrived around midnight that Friday morning exhausted to be told I had to put down a $400 deposit. No where on any site does it state the amount for the deposit just that we needed to make sure to bring our photo ID and the card that would be used.

"This has been the worst rental car experience I have ever had in my more than 50 years of renting automobiles all around the world. First, my initial Fox Renal Car reservation (confirmation #FFX0013685F) was cancelled wrongly, then I was charged $300+ more than my original Reservation agreement and given a lessor car. I was then sent a text saying my rental car was 5 or more days over-due & threatened with legal action.  It was virtually impossible to get in touch with a live agent (2+ hours on hold); and then it took another day to have Fox acknowledge it was their error but offer no compensation. The two cars I rented from Fox in Seattle this summer were ill kept, not cleaned (empty food containers under seats, filthy windows, very high mileage, etc.).  Certainly not cleaned and sanitized to Covid standards. This entire rental experience has been unsatisfactory.",1,US,2020-08-28,Negative,bad rental car experience ever year rent automobile around world first initial fox renal car reservation confirmation ffxf cancel wrongly charge original reservation agreement give lessor car send text say rental car day overdue threatened legal action virtually impossible get touch live agent hour hold take another day fox acknowledge error offer compensation two car rent fox seattle summer ill keep clean empty food container seat filthy window high mileage etc certainly clean sanitized covid standard entire rental experience unsatisfactory,28,August,2020
"always read reviews thinking people are exaggerating, but wow..this place SUCKED. I’ve used Fox before in Arizona but this experience was on another level. I will echo everyone else in saying DO NOT TRY TO SAVE MONEY BY USING THIS COMPANY. Go with Avis, Hertz, Enterprise, ANYONE ELSE! DO NOT EXPECT THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE TO BE HELPFUL. DO NOT EXPECT THEIR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE TO ASSIST YOU WHEN YOU'RE IN NEED. I don’t know where to start. I had a bad feeling about this location as soon as I got there to pick up the car. We rented a black 2017 Jeep Renegade with 53k. The person who helped us when we picked up the car blew through the information and kept trying to upsell us on packages and items without real explanation of the products. A few days into our trip, we were on the road in Idaho where we ended up getting a flat tire. We took the car to a small tire shop and they said the car was unsafe to drive and to try a larger tire shop in the area the following day. That evening, I called Roadside Assistance, Customer Support and any other number that was listed on the paperwork we received. We waited 3 hours to get in touch with someone from their roadside assistance at 6 pm MDT  to only be transferred and disconnected in a matter of 5 minutes with no help whatsoever. I reached out to their social media pages as well and was told that their roadside assistance was 24/7... which didn’t seem to be the case. The next day we took the car to a Les Schwab because we could drive on a flat and they informed us the same thing. The car tires were extremely bald and that one of the tire’s inner wires were showing. I got on the phone finally with a Fox Rent A Car Roadside Assistance rep who was so nice! He informed me that Fox Rent A Car would reimburse me for four new tires. He said that I would have to pay for them on my own because Les Schwab was not one of their vendors and then I’d get reimbursed by Fox Rent A Car and that the SLC location knew about the issue. I received an email of this confirmation information from their rep and went forward with the purchase of tires. We continued our trip as planned and dropped the car off at the end of our trip. The person at the return area was nice and apologized on behalf of the company for the tires when I informed them of the issues we encountered. BUT when I got to the counter to talk to someone the woman said I needed to talk with her manager. She went to get him and he came out to talk with me. As soon as I explained the situation, Tim (no last name given) shut me down. He waved away my paperwork I received from Les Schwab, he also told he doesn’t handle reimbursements at his location that Roadside Assistance does, and he wouldn’t give him his business card. He said he had just moved into his office and didn’t have any. Which I find hard to believe when you were in the same office two weeks prior when I came to pick up the car. He also said he wouldn’t give me his first and last name because he doesn’t give that information out even though he’s the General Manager of the location and he said it was because he didn't want stalkers. He never once apologized for the situation or the condition of the car and basically told me to have a good day. I have emailed the roadside assistance rep back about reimbursement but I have no idea what the deal is with this company and I hope to somehow get reimbursed for tires I didn’t even get to keep. I had to contact my credit card to dispute the charges at this point, because they were so unhelpful. I feel bad for the employees that have to work under this Tim individual and this company.",1,US,2020-08-27,Negative,always read review think people exaggerate wowthis place suck I ve use fox arizona experience another level echo everyone else say try save money use company go avis hertz enterprise anyone else expect customer service helpful expect roadside assistance assist you re need do not know start bad feeling location soon get pick car rent black jeep renegade k person help we pick car blow information keep try upsell we package item without real explanation product day trip road idaho end get flat tire take car small tire shop say car unsafe drive try large tire shop area follow day evening call roadside assistance customer support number list paperwork receive wait hour get touch someone roadside assistance pm mdt transfer disconnected matter minute help whatsoever reach social medium page well tell roadside assistance do not seem case next day take car le schwab could drive flat inform us thing car tire extremely bald one tire inner wire show get phone finally fox rent car roadside assistance rep nice inform fox rent car would reimburse four new tire say would pay les schwab one vendor i d get reimburse fox rent car slc location know issue receive email confirmation information rep go forward purchase tire continue trip plan drop car end trip person return area nice apologize behalf company tire inform issue encounter get counter talk someone woman say need talk manager go get come talk soon explain situation tim last name give shut wave away paperwork receive les schwab also tell do not handle reimbursement location roadside assistance would not give business card say move office do not find hard believe office two week prior come pick car also say would not give first last name do not give information even though he s general manager location say do not want stalker never apologize situation condition car basically tell good day email roadside assistance rep back reimbursement idea deal company hope somehow get reimburse tire do not even get keep contact credit card dispute charge point unhelpful feel bad employee work tim individual company,27,August,2020

"On 8/14 I rented a 2020 dodge charger at the McCarran airport location on south Las Vegas boulevard. The touch screen was dirty,there were smashed cookies in the backseat French fries under the seat 2 half drunk water bottles under the seat and black marks all over the back bumper. We didn't realize this when we picked up the car and had to clean it The next day. The inside of the car is a clear covid violation. Then I dropped it off and the worker burned out in reverse. I got there at 530 and the shuttle didn't arrive until 643 am. I spoke to another customer that said they were waiting 45 minutes when I got there.Several people went inside to complain. The girl behind the counter had"" no idea""where the shuttle was. I missed my flight and had to pay an additional $200 for the next flight. I called to complain and could only speak to the finance department.All she said was that the shuttle is a complimentary service provided to the customers and that customers are ""educated"" on the web site that shuttles run every 15-30 min. She also said ""that's why the airports say get to the airport 2 hrs before your flight,so that you don't miss it"". Even if I got there earlier,I still would have missed my flight because there were people there waiting over an hour and a half for the shuttle. She also said that ""we are not responsible for extra payments from the airlines because you missed your flight"". This is a very calous attitude to have and poor customer service.

"Update as of 8/25/2020, i emailed fox rent a car yesterday with the bad news about delta, no reply as of yet, and today, American Airlines announced it will cut 19,000 jobs in October, due to the fallout from this pandemic and reduced air travel. So again re-enforcing the fact that i will not be using this store credit from Fox Rent a Car, hence I WANT MY $437.00 REFUNDED TO ME IMMEDIATELYAs of today, 8/24/2020, Delta is furloughing 1941 pilots in October due to the fallout from the pandemic and plunging air travel demands,  Yet this lousy substandard low life fox rent a car still refuses to give me a full refund in lue of my store credit which i have that i will never use due to this pandemic.This is a terrible company, a true low life low life car rental companyThis is as of today, 8/20/20, on the news, and Fox Rent A Car still wont give me a full refund, even when i provide facts on why I and nobody else is traveling and have no need for a rental car!!!!WASHINGTON - American Airlines Group Inc said on Thursday it plans to suspend flights to 15 U.S. airports in October as travel demand remains low as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.Congress has been weighing for weeks whether to grant U.S. airlines another $25 billion in payroll assistance that would keep tens of thousands of airline workers on the job for another six months and extend minimum service requirements.American said it will cancel just over 700 flights in October to and from those 15 airports but warned it could make additional cuts or could reconsider if Congress provides more assistance.Looks like i received a reply from Fox Rent a car, today, 8/20/2020 to my original review, only to safe face. They state they will not issue me a full refund, can anyone out there help me on this issue and get me a full refund????here are the facts of this story:october 2019, i made a reservation for a rental car and was charged $437.00, i cancelled my trip to Phoenix for personal reasons and when i called for to request a refund, they said no, and issued me a store credit, but did refund my $150.00 deposit, But still charged me $437.00.so in March i reserved a car for my spring training baseball trip, well, spring training was called off due to the virus, then two days after that Phoenix was shut down, and soon after the whole country was closed down. On July 15, i finally got to speak with a representative from Fox Rent a Car, and i asked for a full refund of my $437.00, stating that i will not be travleling anywhere soon, due to these virus hot spots. Texas is a hot spot, Florida is a hot spot, California is shut down again, Phoenix is a hot spot.Fox flatly refuses to give me a credit for my $437.00, that i was originally charged for back in oct, 2019, on my credit card.I explained that American Airlines issued me a full refund for my March flight, they went out of their way to accommmodate everyone during this national pandemic. But this low life rental car still refuses to issue me a full refund, they put peoples safety, my safety, childrens safety from this virus above a lousy $437.00.This is a despicable rental car company, i advise everyone to get a car from many of the other companies, who now from the loss of business have very great rates and they are far superior to this sub par Fox Rent a car.Please post this on every social media outlet that you can, Fox Rental Car is taking advantage of this national virus pandemic, while people are dying as i type this review, just sickening isn't it?This is the worst rental car company i have ever witnessed, and i urge everyone to share this story, and do not ever rent anything from Fox Rent a Car, not even a Porta Potty.I will never use this store credit from this company, EVER, I will not be traveling until this virus is completely done,",1,US,2020-08-25,Negative,update email fox rent car yesterday bad news delta reply yet today american airline announce cut job october due fallout pandemic reduce air travel reenforce fact use store credit fox rent car hence want refunded immediatelyas today delta furlough pilot october due fallout pandemic plunge air travel demand yet lousy substandard low life fox rent car still refuse give full refund lue store credit never use due pandemicthis terrible company true low life low life car rental companythis today news fox rent car still will not give full refund even provide fact nobody else travel need rental carwashington american airlines group inc say thursday plan suspend flight us airport october travel demand remain low result coronavirus pandemiccongress weigh week whether grant we airline another billion payroll assistance would keep ten thousand airline worker job another six month extend minimum service requirementsamerican say cancel flight october airport warn could make additional cut could reconsider congress provide assistancelook like receive reply fox rent car today original review safe face state issue full refund anyone help issue get full refundhere fact storyoctober make reservation rental car charge cancel trip phoenix personal reason call request refund say issue store credit refund deposit still charge march reserve car spring training baseball trip well spring training call due virus two day phoenix shut soon whole country close july finally get speak representative fox rent car ask full refund state travleling anywhere soon due virus hot spot texas hot spot florida hot spot california shut phoenix hot spotfox flatly refuse give credit originally charge back oct credit cardi explain american airline issue full refund march flight go way accommmodate everyone national pandemic low life rental car still refuse issue full refund put people safety safety children safety virus lousy despicable rental car company advise everyone get car many company loss business great rate far superior sub par fox rent carplease post every social medium outlet fox rental car take advantage national virus pandemic people die type review sickening be not itthis bad rental car company ever witness urge everyone share story ever rent anything fox rent car even porta pottyi never use store credit company ever travel virus completely do,25,August,2020

We rented this car for 2 days only, and they say it shows 5 day in their system! now we are trying to get through to customer service or billing and no one is answering .

"We made it to the rental location in Las Vegas at around 9:30 at night to find two people working the counter.

"The agent who I was assigned to outright lied to try and get me to pay $12 a day for the toll pass (would have cost me an additional $80 or so). Even after I looked up the roads on google and saw that they didn’t have tolls, he told me google was wrong. I thought about talking to management upon my return. But knowing Fox’s reputation and the smoothness with which the agent rattled off the tolls roads, I assume this practice is encouraged by both management and corporate.

I woke up early this morning to get ahold of their customer service and even at 8am EST when they open, i was 9 on the long line. I waited 25 mins, and spoke to Zoey ID# 737. She advised me that i can extend the rental with extra fees and what not. Okay, i get it, the ""Man"" needs to make more money. (fyi, i could return the car, rerent it again for much less, but the travel and time needed to work out weighed that  option). I was then informed that my Chase Credit Card is stopping a new charge from happening and that i will incure another $25 plus the $59.13 already increased extra day rental fee because my card isnt allowing them to charge just the $59.13 fee, SO, HERE IS THE LAUGHABLE PART, THE $25 EXTRA FEE BEING CHARGED BECAUSE MY CREDIT CARD IS ""BLOCKING"" THE NEW $59.13 FEE IT WILL BE TAKEN FROM THE $150 HOLD THEY ALREADY HAVE!!!! This company is NOT here to help its clients, they are here for a quick buck, add on fees and BS customer support.This company Deserves an F- and if i could give it less than 1 star i would.Respectfully,, a 40 year young man who feels sorry for the future to come when ethics are thrown out the window, ignored and rewritten but tiny print and taking advantage of.

"Was highly disappointed and frustrated when I could not get the car I reserved and confirmed through Travelocity. I made a reservation for a full-size car six days before my trip. I was to pick up my car by 8:30 AM. I arrived at the Oakland Airport rental office and was told car available. I saw some other renters standing-by and feeling disappointed. The lady clerk told me to  check at other rental companies or wait for at least one hour. I registered and waited. After a long wait, I had to rent from another company because it was getting late for my trip. I have been on my trip for over 4 before I got a phone call from Fox. What a disappointment!

"Car was great and price of the car was great, but I don't like how they try to upsale you as you're picking up the car. I was talked into purchasing a $10 a day toll pass because the rep said that even one toll would be $20. I will be more prepared next time, but knowing that I was going to be doing a lot of driving, I thought, probably better get it. I spent $80 for the pass and needed it one time. There are 4 or 5 upsale points. Price never comes out to what you were expecting to pay. This is my second or third experience like this with Fox. I would rather have the option when reserving to get all of the extras then just confirm choices at pick up. It would speed things along too. The pick up process takes about 10 minutes per person and when there are 4 clerks and a line of 12 people? You do the math. It's a long time to wait when you've just gotten off a flight and are ready to get to the hotel for the night.",3,US,2020-07-06,Neutral,car great price car great do not like try upsale you re pick car talk purchasing day toll pass rep say even one toll would prepare next time know going lot drive thought probably well get spend pass need one time upsale point price never come expect pay second third experience like fox would rather option reserving get extras confirm choice pick would speed thing along pick process take minute per person clerk line people math long time wait you ve get flight ready get hotel night,6,July,2020

All of our other reservations, at Yosemite and other tourist sites, cancelled on us because it is not safe to be vacationing. Fox car rental would not even answer their phones or return emails to be able to talk to them. I sent emails to the addresses they suggested to other customers with no responses. Very Poor Service!!!As a reply to your reply...June 1st is not long enough, how can you think this pandemic is over. Our reservations were for June 6th and everything was still closed and not safe to fly. Why should someone that booked for May 30 get their money back but June 1st just get a credit. Our granddaughter's graduation was still cancelled, as were our AirBnB reservations for Yosemite. Priceline gave us a refund on hotel reservations that were suppose to be nonrefundable, no questions asked.

"We booked our reservation with AARP/expedia for our trip to Phoenix AZ. Our confirmation said “Your Fox reservation is confirmed! No need to reconfirm.” We thought perfect we are all set for a vacation to see our family.  We boarded our plane all was good. We traveled over 8 hours by plane from Buffalo NY. To arrive in Hot Hot Phoenix.  We were so excited to start our vacation.  We get the shuttle and arrive at the Rental Car Center to find the line to Fox Rent A Car all the way out to the main concourse area of the center and only one employee behind the desk. We think well this is going to be at least an hour but, were here and almost on the way to our hotel. With in 15 minutes that dream ended. We were harshly informed that they have no rental cars.  What is the point of a reservation. This is only our second visit to AZ where we rented a car.  So we had no idea the set up.  So we called our son who started to drive out which was 45 minutes away. After about 15 minutes we asked the only employee we saw walking by if our son was able to pick up outside. We quickly found out no. We had to text our son and tell him that we would be there but, he didn’t know where that was and we didn’t either. Our phones were less than 5% as we had been traveling over 8 hours by now.  We had to walk in the 110 degree heat to an empty parking lot, no cover and no one around. A relaxing vacation has turned into hectic confusion and chaotic. Very disappointed in your company.

"Worst car rental company I’ve ever had to deal with by far. I went online this morning and caused some confusion about the policies so I called and had the representative walk me through the steps and I told him that I recently moved to Michigan and because of the lockdown due to COVID- 19, that I do not have a Michigan drivers license I only have my old California address on my license and I told him that I don’t have a major credit card only a debit card he said that was fine as long is I put that information into the system it would be fine because the name still matches and the billing address for the debit card was for Michigan So I did that and I did the pre-paid option since it was cheaper and immediately after that a family member brought it to my attention that they might not accept the drivers license even though we entered in their website that it was a California license so I called back and after being put on hold for 40 minutes once again, the representative that answered told me that “no if you don’t have an out of state license and you only have a local address on your drivers license from the area that you are going to Rent the car from” that they won’t accept it and because I did a pre-paid option that i would lose my money -we’re talking almost $300...So the guy told me to argue with their billing department and so he transferred me and after being on hold for another 1.5 hours, I finally got through to someone even though she argued with me she agreed to refund it however she disconnected the phone call as she claimed she was processing it! no one called me back at all and instead of refunding me they actually charged me they did cancel the reservation but they charged me in full for the price of the vehicle.I cannot get over the poor quality customer service and having being on hold for over two hours and then disconnect and not bothering to call them back I don’t know what kind of system they are using that they cannot see the customers callback information for something like this that is incredibly upsetting since overall I’ve been dealing with this company for three hours today not only do they have a very poor policy in place And poor outlook on what good customer service is. I have rented several cars in my life and I’ve never dealt with something like this. Now I’m going to have to call and be put on hold for another two hours before I can get a hold of someone it’s absolutely insane how they have their system set up and I’m going to have to argue now because obviously the woman didn’t do what she said she was going to do so now I’m gonna have to somehow prove what I was promised which I’m not feeling very optimistic about at this point.",1,US,2020-06-16,Negative,bad car rental company I ve ever deal far go online morning cause confusion policy call representative walk step told recently move michigan lockdown due covid michigan driver license old california address license tell do not major credit card debit card say fine long put information system would fine name still match billing address debit card michigan prepay option since cheap immediately family member bring attention might accept driver license even though enter website california license call back put hold minute representative answer tell do not state license local address driver license area go rent car will not accept prepaid option would lose money talk almost guy tell argue billing department transfer hold another hour finally get someone even though argued agree refund however disconnected phone call claim process one call back instead refund actually charge cancel reservation charge full price vehiclei get poor quality customer service hold two hour disconnect bothering call back do not know kind system use see customer callback information something like incredibly upsetting since overall I ve deal company three hour today poor policy place poor outlook good customer service rent several car life I ve never deal something like I m go call put hold another two hour get hold someone absolutely insane system set I m go argue obviously woman do not say go I m go to somehow prove promise I m feel optimistic point,16,June,2020
"If I could describe what I’ve dealt with thus far with fox in two words, I would say “Terrible experience”. I arrived upon opening time at Fort Lauderdale airport to pick up the vehicle and there were so many technical difficulties. The rep told me that their system was down after swiping my card for payment and I couldn’t get the car until the system came back up. After almost an hour of waiting and the system didn’t come back up, the rep eventually gave me a paper to sign as a contract... why wasn’t that thought of before wasting my hour? Not only that, I was charged an underage fee during this time of COVID-19. All other major car rental companies were waving underage fees until June 30. I booked with fox because I knew they were waiving it but when I got there, I was informed that it is no longer being waived as a of last week because things have gone “back to normal”. After the hour of waiting, I spent an additional 30 minutes to get a vehicle. The first vehicle I got popped up with an “oil change” message on the dash board before I could even put the car in drive. It was a hassle to grab my luggage to go from car to car to find one that was actually working. Before and after getting the rental, I attempted to contact both the local location and the customer service line and couldn’t get in contact with neither. The line said “there are more than 10 callers ahead of you” and after waiting for 30 plus minutes the call automatically ended. I understand that now may be a tough time but it seemed as if no one was trying to help. The airport was empty when I went and phones just weren’t being answered. This experience was like no other honestly. The prices at fox attracted me but after this experience, I’ll probably never book with them again.",1,US,2020-06-15,Negative,could describe I ve deal thus far fox two word would say terrible experience arrive upon opening time fort lauderdale airport pick vehicle many technical difficulty rep tell system swipe card payment could not get car system come back almost hour waiting system do not come back rep eventually give paper sign contract be not think waste hour charge underage fee time covid major car rental company wave underage fee june booked fox know waive get inform long waive last week thing go back normal hour waiting spend additional minute get vehicle first vehicle get pop oil change message dash board could even put car drive hassle grab luggage go car car find one actually work get rental attempt contact local location customer service line could not get contact neither line say caller ahead wait plus minute call automatically end understand may tough time seem one try help airport empty go phone be not answer experience like honestly price fox attract experience ill probably never book,15,June,2020

I think it’s very misleading to bring people in under the pretext  that you have a jeep wranglers for rent. worst part was having to wait in Aline for one hour.

"Initially we posted a Good review on Fox rental when we rented a car from them 3/1-3/7/20.  My wallet went missing on our return trip from Tampa. We noticed it after going through TSA. TSA contacted us immediately and said it was not found there. We spoke to Fox’s corporate office in California and received confirmation from them that they had emailed the Tampa branch twice to contact us. We could not get them to contact us to let us know if the wallet was left in the car or  even if they has looked in the car. We are considering it a theft by Fox, since they will not contact us. I had to replace all my cards, checkbooks, etc including my social security card. My mother had just died and the inability to talk to them is inexcusable. We will be filing a police report that we feel it is a theft at this time by Fox. We  had put a good review on Facebook which we will change. This all occurred long before the coronavirus caused cancellation and even any interruption of business so we don’t feel there is any excuse on their part.

"Terrible from start to finish. I pre booked a car in December 19 to pick up on February 27th of February. I pre paid for everything before travelling at a cost of $429 with a remaining $136 to pay on pick up.The shuttle from the airport to Semoran Boulevard was great with only a 5 minute wait and 15 minute transfer, bus driver was helpful polite and very welcoming. The troubles started the minute we got of the bus, the guy at the counter took our details and started to process our vehicle and then hit me with a final total of $525 😢 one of the charges was for toll roads and the other for full to empty which I didn’t want as knew the was a fuel stop just up the road and the other was for some sort of insurance that he is sited I would need, after 40 minutes standing and trying to say I did not want any extras I crumbled and just paid the money as my wife and the rest of our party were getting fed up of waiting and getting restless after the long journey, when he handed us the keys they were for a for a Toyota runner, I asked if this was going to being enough for our party and explained that I had booked the Ford Explorer which has 7 seats and room for 4 large cases and he said yeh there are only 4 of you, disgruntled I went out to find the car and was again disappointed as the car was damaged in the outside had the highest mileage on any hire car I have ever seen and the inside was scratched on the dash with work mats on the floor and when we opened the back doors the rubber trims were hanging down on both rear passenger doors.  I know a hire car has been used and expect some wear and tear but this was way above that and although I am not a prima donna I do expect a certain level when paying over the odds for a nice car to treat the family too for a special holiday.  I looked around the car park to see if there were any larger cars resembling the Explorer and couldn’t see one so wonder if they do actually supply this model !,!On a positive the return trip on the shuttle was again exemplary and.

I used Fox rental at Fort Myers  Airport  (RSW). After over 50 rental car experiences I had the worst experience for renting a car at this location. I went to the pickup area and just missed the shuttle.  It was 20 minutes before the next shttle arrived and it filled quickly and left many people waiting for the next one.  When we arrived at the rental facility there was a line in the office running out the door and down the exterior ramp.

"We had an excellent experience.Our front desk attendant was very friendly and honest about what we needed or didn’t need. Our vehicle was ready when we arrived. They offered us their special to upgrade (at an additional cost), we decided we didn’t need the extra space. No pressure at all. We paid for their toll pass for the 14 days we had the vehicle. Smartest move we made! Every road seemed to have a toll on it. We paid their “we fill” gas rate and didn’t have to fill the tank before returning. It was more of a convenience to us, as we didn’t have to pay the higher priced gas by the airport. Drop off was a breeze (although I missed the turn in lane and had to double back). There are no back entrances, so you have to keep an eye out for this drive way. Overall, we had a great experience. Everyone was very friendly and helpful!

"I do not typically write reviews, but my experience at Fox Rental Car in Salt Lake City was such an awful example of poor company policies and even worse customer service that I feel the need to write this review. I waited about an hour for the shuttle bus to go to the offsite location. Shuttle bus driver did not let most people on, stating guests could not stand on the bus. Had to wait another 20 minutes for the next bus (interestingly that driver said riders could stand). Waited another hour at the location, witnessing customer after customer not get the car they ordered - it is Salt Lake City in the winter and most customers have skis, yet the company overbooks SUVs but then don’t have the vehicles when you arrive. I, however, was not skiing and wanted only a compact car. Upon finally arriving to the desk, I was told my reservation was released because I did not arrive within 3 hours of my rental reservation. Of course, I tried to explain that the majority of that time was spent waiting for shuttle buses or on the line, but to no avail. I then asked to have the representative at the desk make me a new reservation at the desk but he said no. The explanation was that they had no cars to rent. While at the desk I made a new reservation (apparently they do have cars).

"My wife and I waited over 45 minutes in a line of 6 renters in Austin last week.  It seemed to be an issue of either first time renters who couldn't understand all the add-on's the Fox representative threw at them, or how they would pay for the rental.  One renter wasted 25-30 minutes renting a car.  The rep. should have moved them through the rental process but didn't.  The one star is for the vehicle we finally received.  The car was relatively new, and ran well.What has not happened is when I returned the vehicle, the rep said she would e-mail a copy of the bill to be.  That was 5 days ago, and no e-mail.  However, in the meantime, Fox has charged me $ 54.08 over the confirmation figure they sent me.  Now I am on hold for 32 minutes to speak with a rep.  Who Knows if they will solve the issue.  OK, now 52 minutes later and still waiting for an Live Chat rep, the screen says 2 in a line for the last 34 minutes, and to wait another 16 minutes, RIGHT!Heard back late this afternoon from Fox, who say they can't find my rental agreement, and that I arrived late to their counter, even though we arrived in Austin only 17 minutes late according to FlightAware, and after picking up our luggage, we were in their line about 40 minutes later than the rental confirmation time.  They say we arrived at their counter over THREE HOURS later and lost our car hold.  Beginning to wonder how they remain in business. If they cannot find it today, I will challenge the charge on my credit card so that they can find the agreement!OK, it's been two weeks and after my immediate reply to the individual who said we were THREE HOURS late, not another reply from Fox.  Late last week, I filed a complaint with my credit card company challenging Fox to produce an invoice.

"Inre: Fox Booking Number WFX036793ABernardo at Fox's Valencia call center was very efficient and professional in helping me clean up the mistakes from the extremely bad service I received from another Fox Rent a car employees I spoke with earlier that same day (Saturday morning Feb. 8). The problem began when I called Fox to find out why my credit card payment for a booking in Las Vegas (which I was attempting to make  online) wouldn't go through.  After about two hours or so, just as the problem was close to getting resolved, the man who was supposed to be helping me hung up the phone, causing me to spend the rest of the day trying to get my payment to go through. In frustration, I called back Fox late in the day and this time got Bernardo, who promptly fixed the problem and credited me back $28, about $25 less than I would have paid if my problem was dealt with professionally and the other guy who was helping me hadn't hung up the phone before my problem could be resolved, which wasted  hours more of my time and (after the adjustment made by Bernardo) cost me about $25 more that I should have ordinarily paid on my $600 booking) it the original Fox rep had done a better job.  As a long time Fox customer, I believe that under these circumstances additional compensation is justified.  I am grateful to Bernardo, but at the same time look forward to hearing from you about my request for an additional adjustment to make up the difference from what I would have paid and also to compensate me for the time that I lost unnecessarily in completing this booking. The difference between an ""A"" (Bernardo) and an ""F"" (the original Fox employee) is Average.  How Fox responds will help me weight whether to give the company a higher rating in the future but also whether to give it my future business.

"First time renting with Fox. I rented near the Salt Lake City airport. I had reserved a Special SUV, which was noted as a Jeep Wrangler or similar on the website and the confirmation. They did'nt have one when I arrived and offered me a Volkswagon Jetta instead, and at the price of the Special SUV. Small car, same price? In my opinion, a discount should be offered if I'm being given a much lower rental class. Unfortunately, it was late at night and near closing time. I was told this was the best they could do. OK, but in my experience with other rental companies the vehicle will be upgraded or there will be a discount.

I don’t know how either one of them are considered a reasaonable alternative to a convertible camaro. Because I booked it thru priceline they would not refund my money so I could go elsewhere and get the car I wanted.

That was slick at best, deceptive if you're cynical. I was only going to drive about 100 miles while I had the car, so I had no incentive to bring a car back over 1/2 full with their ""cheap"" gas. It's pretty hard to take that gas with you on the plane.Also, the car's mileage on my contract was about 200 miles lower than what I saw on the odometer when I got in the car.

I tried to fight the charges with a manager to no avail.  The only additional options I asked for were 2 car seats and the toll pass.  No insurance.  And the bill still had a $350 mark up!  Ridiculous!  I was so angry but it was midnight and I had 3 small children with me so going back to the airport would have been too much.

"My wife and I took the car for a 4-day short vacation at Arizona Airport. They stood in line for 40 minutes. Then we could not find a car for 50 minutes. Although we had a car reservation. In the end, around midnight, they gave us a car. The man who gave me the car keys was rude. I asked him why the front bumper is broken? He raised his voice and said that it doesn’t matter. We left the airport and after 30 minutes we heard a strange sound under the front bumper. He was getting louder and louder. I called road assistance but no one answered. I left an audio message and asked me to call back. It was 00:30 AM. We stopped at the nearest gas station to see the reason. I saw under the front bumper that some part is hanging on the wires and dragging along the asphalt. I asked for paper clips and tied this part to the bumper of the car. We had to drive another 2 hours. I don’t know what kind of wires these are and what happened to the car. (I attach the photo) I don’t know what my wife would do if she was alone and took such a car after an accident. When we returned the car after 4 days at the airport, I told the manager Jan everything and showed a photo of how it was. He said sorry and that’s all. I asked if he would like to make us compensation? He said that Fox does not do such a service. Then he asked to describe everything and leave it to him. I wrote my complaint and left him. Frankly, there was an unpleasant impression of such a service. Most likely I will not want to use the services of the Fox company anymore.

"Already regretting my decision to rent from Fox. This is my first and last time and I haven't even gotten the car yet. I noticed I was charged a $150 deposit fee along with the total amount of my reservation and asked that the deposit fee be returned. The online chat person said the deposit would remain to ensure the car was returned in the same condition it was given to me. I understand a full tank of gas and not trashed but she refused to elaborate if a car wash/vacuum is required and just kept saying CLEAN and IN THE SAME CONDITION IT WAS GIVEN TO YOU. Obviously this is a racket to keep the additional $150. The company has the credit card on file and all other rental car companies charge that card if the tank isn't full. My rental isn't for 2 weeks so I'll update when I actually get the vehicle, which I see from other reviews is NOT guaranteed to be the same car/class as rented. Needless to say I'm sure it's going to be the worst rental experience I've ever had and I should have paid the extra money to use a reputable company (Dollar, Enterprise, etc.).

"I rent a car (Hyundai Santa Fe) at Foxrentacar of Miami airport from 17 Dec to 9 jan. Paid in advance $1513 ! You may wonder why so much !? I preferred to pay all the additional insurance coverages, plus the Platepass, to enjoy thoughtless my holidays and to avoid finding surprise charges on my credit card at the delivery of the car. But it wasn't enough ! I received a notice charge for an amount of $78,23 of rental car toll charge. Here is only $3.23 toll charges and $75 administrative fees ! Crazy ! I had previously already paid the PlatePass for the period December 17 until January 9. It's not the first time I've had problems with this rental. Unfortunately I had to choose it again just because I had a credit store to spend. Employees from the Miami office, on the day of my arrival, were having trouble viewing the contract on the computer(you are warned: here the problems happen very often!).  For this, they had to make a temporary new agreement only for one day, until the problem was resolved the next day. I had to come back the next day, driving many miles. Evidently they forgot to apply the platepass for that day. This is definitely not my problem.I do not find a good reason to choose FoxRentacar of Miami : It is not convenient, the pickup point is much more distant than all the other rentals, every time there are problems and surprises on the bill. Stay away !----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update !FoxRentacar suggested I write to the billing customer assistance to assist me. I did it, I gave the charge request number but they didn't even bother to read it. They wrote to me that it might be some charge of some road not covered by Platepass. But this is not the case, this is the list of charges :SR112 EAST(32nd ave)-$0.66I95 NW 144TH ST EXPR -$0.75SR112 WEST (17TH AVE)-$0.66SR112 EAST (17TH AVE)-$0.66I-95 MIAMIGARDENS EXPR-$0.5Total Toll Charges $3.23Total Administrative Fees $75Total Amount Due $78.23This is ridiculous !Everything works badly here, including billing customer service! Think about it for a moment: I came from Italy to Miami to spend a happy holiday. I paid more than 1500 bucks to get a ""cheap"" car for 22 days. I arrived tired after so many hours of flying with three children at the pick-up point. The car wasn't ready because of people uncapable do their job. I had to come back the next day to solve this problem. I came home to Italy and I still have problems !

"***EDIT***  Since I can't reply to the company's reply - that wasn't something that was disclosed to us by Travelocity.  Additionally, had that little bit of information been shared while he was standing at the counter, he would have used his American Express (credit card, not a debit card) at the time of rental instead of canceling his reservation altogether.  I wish I could give zero stars.  My husband went down to San Diego for a business trip in which he needed an SUV for equipment.  We booked on Travelocity with Fox Rent A Car for a decent price.  Only, when he got there, they surprised him with a ONE HUNDRED PERCENT deposit fee!  So on top of the $400 for the rental and $200 in taxes and fees, they wanted another $400 deposit!  When my husband asked them why so high, he was told by the guy at the counter that other companies charge higher deposits.  Not necessarily true.  We travel often and get rental cars everywhere we go.  The most we've been charged is 20%.  I highly recommend that you don't go with Fox Rent A Car if you don't have to.

"I have rented with Fox several times. The first few were just fine and I was happy to use them again despite their somewhat low reviews on several platforms. This last time the counter staff was wonderful, helpful, and quick! Once I was at my car I marked a couple of blemishes on the vehicle, including the top trip popping up. As I was driving the vehicle I noticed that the inside of the drivers door had some terrible streaking down the whole thing, like someone sprayed it with something and just let it sit there and dry. Didn't impact the drive. But then later as I was getting out of the car I noticed the trim below the door was also pulling away from the car. While I was driving the vehicle something started rolling around by my feet. when I stopped I looked under the seat and found an insulin injection pen. Thank goodness I didn't have kids that could've picked it up! I placed the pen in the cup holder and notified the staff member when I turned the vehicle in. I don't know how to properly dispose of them. I also had the front passenger window roll down on its own while I was driving. When I went to put it back up the button the drivers side was broken. So I had to pull over and lean into the passengers seat to put the window up. Again, I have had 2 or 3 prior rental experiences that were good with this company. I clearly got a vehicle with a lot of issues this time. It was disappointing.",3,US,2020-01-13,Neutral,rent fox several time first fine happy use despite somewhat low review several platform last time counter staff wonderful helpful quick car mark couple blemish vehicle include top trip pop driving vehicle notice inside driver door terrible streaking whole thing like someone spray something let sit dry do not impact drive later get car notice trim door also pull away car drive vehicle something start roll around foot stop look seat find insulin injection pen thank goodness do not kid could ve pick place pen cup holder notify staff member turn vehicle do not know properly dispose also front passenger window roll driving go put back button driver side broken pull lean passenger seat put window prior rental experience good company clearly get vehicle lot issue time disappointing,13,January,2020

"I rented a car recently from your Denver location on January 2, 2020 around noon. I wanted to share my experience with and hopefully shed some light why I will never engage in business with your company again and will ensure to pass along my experience with others. My mother was with me and is an avid traveler and rents cars frequently. She also was appalled at the level of service and will never give you her business and intends to pass it along to the many people she travels with. During this first encounter, I would love to give the name of the female employee who helped me but she wasn’t wearing a name badge and failed to introduce herself. I can appreciate how long the process takes to check out rental cars as I have gone through the process countless times. This was by far the rudest and most unpleasant experience I have had. The lady failed to introduce herself and the only time she made eye contact was when she was giving me attitude and then would roll her eyes. I had requested a 4x4 and she walked off to check if any were available. While she was gone, I checked with the people I was visiting via text and they informed me a 4x4 wouldn’t be necessary because there wasn’t an issue with snow while I was visiting. Once the employee came back, I told her I wouldn’t be needing the 4x4 and the 2x2 would suffice. She cocked her head to the side looked at me and said, “You should have told me that before I walked over there to check,” and thee rolled her eyes. The rest of the encounter was short and curt and everything she said was dripping with attitude. After wee were finished, there was no “thank you, have a nice day,” nothing. She tossed the keys at me and turned her back to me. When we returned the car on January 7th, around 5 p.m., I wanted to make it a point to ask an employee what this persons name was. To my surprise, the employee I approached was her. I told her, “Perfect, just who I wanted to see. What is your name?” She replied, “Why do you need my name?” I said, “Because you aren’t wearing a name tag and I want to know your name.” She said, “What for?” I said, “Are you seriously not going to give me your name?” She said, “What do you need my name for?” I said, “This is unbelievable that you won’t tell me what your name is. I want to let the company know what type of service I received from you. What is your name?” She said her name was Tigist. I asked her to spell it for me because it was not a common name. She said, “Why do you need my name?” She then asked for a male employee who was a few computers down who was named Jason/Justin to come over and talk to me. I told her this was beyond unprofessional and unbelievable that she wouldn’t give me her name so I can spell it. She started typing on the computer and then looked at the invoice I had and pointed to the spelling of the name on the receipt. I told her perfect and she should perhaps find employment with a different company because she had horrible customer service skills. She then rolled her eyes at me and I left. The acronym for FOX is not fitting for what this company delivers. I laughed when I saw what FOX stood for. I am not the only one. Your rental company has some of the worst customer reviews on Yelp, Google, and other platforms.

We waited for over an hour for the representative to let us know that even though we had a reservation for over a month, they did not have a car for us.  Then at the last minute, someone returned a car and Fox said we could take that one ""as is"".  They said they didn't have time to clean it.  At this point we didn't really have a choice.  We got out to the car & it was on empty (the least of our problems).  Whoever had it before us was very disgusting!  We filled up a whole bag of trash (including bloody tissues in the driver side door).  Thankfully we took video and pictures of everything.  We tried to get several different workers to come inspect the car so we would not be charged for any damage, but they all said they were to busy! When we returned the car we told them that we did not fill up the tank because it was empty when we got it and they said that was no problem.  However, they ended up charging us to fill it up & we did not get out full deposit back.  I had to call customer service & email them the pictures.

"We rented a car in Las Vegas on Dec 26 and from the beginning it was a bad experience.  When I got to the desk I greeted the agent and said how are you and she said 'I've been better'.  After that it was all downhill.  We were almost forced to buy insurance from the agent until the end when she gave up as they get a commission...The car we received was not a luxury car we asked for and her explanation was 'that is all we have'.  When I got in the car it smelled of cigarette smoke and I have two small children...again, she said that is all we have.  We drove the car for 9 days which went fine other than the car having really poor shocks and would bottom out on every larger bump in the road.  When we arrived at SFO Airport the agent said that the rear exhaust had been hit and asked me where I had an accident...I said I did not have an accident other than the car bottoming out on every bounce.  She neglected to listen and made me fill out an accident form which I just wrote on it 'we did not have an accident'.

"I had a rental reserved with enterprise which I cancelled because it was so expensive.  i reserved a jeep to go into the mountains.  When I went to pick it up, the jeep did not have 4 wheel drive so I had to switch vehicles. The jeep was rented for $75/day and was prepaid.  The bill with taxes was $527. The girl told me the car would be $60 dollars a day, I had already prepaid the previous amount so I tried to ask her if it was going to cost me any extra and she said it would automatically charge to my card. She did not explain that the $60 a day was in addition to the $75 I had already prepaid.  As I signed the bill, I didn't know if the other charge had been reversed, she didn't explain things well at all.  The  rental ended up costing me over $919 for a 5 day rental which was $135 a day plus taxes for a total of $183 a day. And yes this was the final amount after the security deposit of $150 was reversed.

So I hung up, and made my reservation with the “pay later” option.  I can’t understand why you wouldn’t want people paying for their reservation now, but apparently that’s their policy.

Absolutely terrible experience at SLC.  I booked through an airline website and was excited that I received a good price and nice car.  I took the shuttle to the office - about a 10 minute ride.  This is where the terrible service started.  We were about the 4th group in line.  It took nearly 30 minutes to get to the counter.  I gave my license and credit card and the representative staid that they could not rent me a car because I already had a car out from the other side of the country.  She looks at the other reservation and tells me that it matches my driver's license number but that the name is different.  Sounds to me like a data entry problem on the other reservation and should be easy to clear up.  She tells me that I cannot have 2 reservations.  I agree and tell her that my name and is only on the current reservation. She says to luck.  I ask her to see if she can clear up the wrong number - she says no and gives me the 800 number.  I call about 3 times and wait for over 30 minutes each time.  Per the prompt I leave my number so I can get a call back - it never came.  I was not charged for either car - because I did not rent on that day.  We took the shuttle back to the airport and rented a car from Enterprise - not as good of a price but they provided great service.  I will NEVER rent a car from FOX again.  Avoid this company and their very poor service - doesn't matter the price they quote.  Just try and resolve a problem - it won't happen.  Even sent a message through their website - with no response.

"I chose to rent from Fox in San Antonio because they advertised a lower price than other companies. I only needed the car for one night- picking it up at 6PM and returning around 6AM, and it was just me, so I went with the economy option, and did not have high expectations at all. Yet somehow I was still disappointed. The maintenance symbol was illuminated on the dashboard - which the employee quickly dismissed as ""oh, it just needs an oil change"" -but the grumbling from the engine made me wonder how long it has needed that oil change. The worst part was that after I returned the car and looked at the receipt, I saw that I was charged more than my initial quote. Apparently, they set my return time as 6AM - and if you are later than that, you incur additional fees - even though I still had it less than 24 hrs. I have tried contacting the company about this but they have not responded. In summary, they get a poor rating for the condition and safety of the cars, a poor rating for deceptive pricing, and a poor rating for customer service.

This is the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with. I flew into Fort Myers Florida last week. Upon arrival to this trailer I go inside and there is at least 12 people in line with two agents. We waited at least an hour in line. They are a VERY deceitful company. First off they charge you $1000 deposit. Really? $1000!!!  The car we got was filthy inside and out with deep scratches on the car. The restroom was gross and it felt like I was going to fall thru the holes they had in the floor.   The woman at the counter was a grump.  She tried to charge me $13.95 per day as a secondary driver on my HUSBANDS reservation. She told us that to extend our car rental it would be $25 a day.

"I've been a 'member' of Fox Rent a Car's rewards program for years and haven't had a problem with making a reservation on their website up until the past year. I log in, make a reservation and when I go to the 'pay now' option to receive a discount, I can't pay. I repeatedly receive a notification saying ""you've exceeded the number of tries with your credit card'' after the first attempt. I've tried to contact the 'help desk' multiple times with no reply or when I do reach someone their solution is to 'log out and log back in', which has never worked once. The site is flawed. I've tired to change the credit card I have on file as a possible solution, but there is nowhere to change it on the site. This is extremely frustrating as I travel a lot for business and try to rent cars from Fox frequently. Fox, please, update your site to work as it should!",2,US,2019-12-09,Negative,I ve member fox rent car reward program year have not problem make reservation website past year log make reservation go pay option receive discount can not pay repeatedly receive notification say you ve exceed number try credit card first attempt I ve try contact help desk multiple time reply reach someone solution log log back never work site flaw I ve tired change credit card file possible solution nowhere change site extremely frustrating travel lot business try rent car fox frequently fox please update site work,9,December,2019
